=== /health
This endpoint is an indication of the health of the application. It has an overall status
("UP", "DOWN" etc.), which is the only thing you see unless either you are authenticated
or the endpoint is marked as `sensitive=false` (`endpoints.health.sensitive=false`).

The HTTP code in the response reflects the status (e.g. "`UP`"=200,
"`OUT_OF_SERVICE`"=503, "`DOWN`"=503). The mappings can be changed by configuring
`endpoints.health.mapping.<STATUS>=XXX`.
