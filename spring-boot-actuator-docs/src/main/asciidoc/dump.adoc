=== Link: dump
This endpoint is a thread dump: the result is a list of threads each with their name,
monitor state and stack. It is the same information as you would get from `kill -3` of a
running Java process. Can be very useful for detecting issues at runtime, especially
sluggish behaviour caused by threads blocked by slow or unavailable I/O (e.g. if a
connection pool is exhausted).

NOTE: some `SecurityManager` implementations might prevent this endpoint from working.
