=== /env
This endpoint is a dump of the Spring `Environment`. It lists the active profiles and all
the `PropertySources` in the `Environment` (the ones that are listed first take precedence
when binding to `@ConfigurationProperties` or `@Value`). Normally you will see the Java
`System` properties and the OS environment variables in their own `PropertySources` plus
any `.properties` or `.yml` files used to configure the application on start up.
