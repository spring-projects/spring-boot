= Build Tool Plugins
include::attributes.adoc[]

Spring Boot provides build tool plugins for Maven and Gradle.
The plugins offer a variety of features, including the packaging of executable jars.
This section provides more details on both plugins as well as some help should you need to extend an unsupported build system.
If you are just getting started, you might want to read "`<<using-spring-boot.adoc#using-boot-build-systems>>`" from the "`<<using-spring-boot.adoc#using-boot>>`" section first.



[[build-tool-plugins-maven-plugin]]
== Spring Boot Maven Plugin
The Spring Boot Maven Plugin provides Spring Boot support in Maven, letting you package executable jar or war archives and run an application "`in-place`".
To use it, you must use Maven 3.2 (or later).

Please refer to the plugin's documentation to learn more:

* Reference ({spring-boot-maven-plugin-docs}[HTML] and {spring-boot-maven-plugin-pdfdocs}[PDF])
* {spring-boot-maven-plugin-api}[API]


[[build-tool-plugins-gradle-plugin]]
== Spring Boot Gradle Plugin
The Spring Boot Gradle Plugin provides Spring Boot support in Gradle, letting you package executable jar or war archives, run Spring Boot applications, and use the dependency management provided by `spring-boot-dependencies`.
It requires Gradle 6 (6.3 or later).
Gradle 5.6.x is also supported but this support is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
Please refer to the plugin's documentation to learn more:

* Reference ({spring-boot-gradle-plugin-docs}[HTML] and {spring-boot-gradle-plugin-pdfdocs}[PDF])
* {spring-boot-gradle-plugin-api}[API]



[[build-tool-plugins-antlib]]
== Spring Boot AntLib Module
The Spring Boot AntLib module provides basic Spring Boot support for Apache Ant.
You can use the module to create executable jars.
To use the module, you need to declare an additional `spring-boot` namespace in your `build.xml`, as shown in the following example:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
	<project xmlns:ivy="antlib:org.apache.ivy.ant"
		xmlns:spring-boot="antlib:org.springframework.boot.ant"
		name="myapp" default="build">
		...
	</project>
----

You need to remember to start Ant using the `-lib` option, as shown in the following example:

[indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
	$ ant -lib <folder containing spring-boot-antlib-{spring-boot-version}.jar>
----

TIP: The "`Using Spring Boot`" section includes a more complete example of <<using-spring-boot.adoc#using-boot-ant, using Apache Ant with `spring-boot-antlib`>>.



[[spring-boot-ant-tasks]]
=== Spring Boot Ant Tasks
Once the `spring-boot-antlib` namespace has been declared, the following additional tasks are available:

* <<spring-boot-ant-exejar>>
* <<spring-boot-ant-findmainclass>>



[[spring-boot-ant-exejar]]
==== Using the "`exejar`" Task
You can use the `exejar` task to create a Spring Boot executable jar.
The following attributes are supported by the task:

[cols="1,2,2"]
|====
| Attribute | Description | Required

| `destfile`
| The destination jar file to create
| Yes

| `classes`
| The root directory of Java class files
| Yes

| `start-class`
| The main application class to run
| No _(the default is the first class found that declares a `main` method)_
|====

The following nested elements can be used with the task:

[cols="1,4"]
|====
| Element | Description

| `resources`
| One or more {ant-docs}/Types/resources.html#collection[Resource Collections] describing a set of {ant-docs}/Types/resources.html[Resources] that should be added to the content of the created +jar+ file.

| `lib`
| One or more {ant-docs}/Types/resources.html#collection[Resource Collections] that should be added to the set of jar libraries that make up the runtime dependency classpath of the application.
|====




[[spring-boot-ant-exejar-examples]]
==== Examples
This section shows two examples of Ant tasks.

.Specify +start-class+
[source,xml,indent=0]
----
	<spring-boot:exejar destfile="target/my-application.jar"
			classes="target/classes" start-class="com.example.MyApplication">
		<resources>
			<fileset dir="src/main/resources" />
		</resources>
		<lib>
			<fileset dir="lib" />
		</lib>
	</spring-boot:exejar>
----

.Detect +start-class+
[source,xml,indent=0]
----
	<exejar destfile="target/my-application.jar" classes="target/classes">
		<lib>
			<fileset dir="lib" />
		</lib>
	</exejar>
----



[[spring-boot-ant-findmainclass]]
=== Using the "`findmainclass`" Task
The `findmainclass` task is used internally by `exejar` to locate a class declaring a `main`.
If necessary, you can also use this task directly in your build.
The following attributes are supported:

[cols="1,2,2"]
|====
| Attribute | Description | Required

| `classesroot`
| The root directory of Java class files
| Yes _(unless `mainclass` is specified)_

| `mainclass`
| Can be used to short-circuit the `main` class search
| No

| `property`
| The Ant property that should be set with the result
| No _(result will be logged if unspecified)_
|====



[[spring-boot-ant-findmainclass-examples]]
==== Examples
This section contains three examples of using `findmainclass`.

.Find and log
[source,xml,indent=0]
----
	<findmainclass classesroot="target/classes" />
----

.Find and set
[source,xml,indent=0]
----
	<findmainclass classesroot="target/classes" property="main-class" />
----

.Override and set
[source,xml,indent=0]
----
	<findmainclass mainclass="com.example.MainClass" property="main-class" />
----



[[build-tool-plugins-other-build-systems]]
== Supporting Other Build Systems
If you want to use a build tool other than Maven, Gradle, or Ant, you likely need to develop your own plugin.
Executable jars need to follow a specific format and certain entries need to be written in an uncompressed form (see the "`<<appendix-executable-jar-format.adoc#executable-jar, executable jar format>>`" section in the appendix for details).

The Spring Boot Maven and Gradle plugins both make use of `spring-boot-loader-tools` to actually generate jars.
If you need to, you may use this library directly.



[[build-tool-plugins-repackaging-archives]]
=== Repackaging Archives
To repackage an existing archive so that it becomes a self-contained executable archive, use `org.springframework.boot.loader.tools.Repackager`.
The `Repackager` class takes a single constructor argument that refers to an existing jar or war archive.
Use one of the two available `repackage()` methods to either replace the original file or write to a new destination.
Various settings can also be configured on the repackager before it is run.



[[build-tool-plugins-nested-libraries]]
=== Nested Libraries
When repackaging an archive, you can include references to dependency files by using the `org.springframework.boot.loader.tools.Libraries` interface.
We do not provide any concrete implementations of `Libraries` here as they are usually build-system-specific.

If your archive already includes libraries, you can use `Libraries.NONE`.



[[build-tool-plugins-find-a-main-class]]
=== Finding a Main Class
If you do not use `Repackager.setMainClass()` to specify a main class, the repackager uses https://asm.ow2.io/[ASM] to read class files and tries to find a suitable class with a `public static void main(String[] args)` method.
An exception is thrown if more than one candidate is found.



[[build-tool-plugins-repackage-implementation]]
=== Example Repackage Implementation
The following example shows a typical repackage implementation:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
	Repackager repackager = new Repackager(sourceJarFile);
	repackager.setBackupSource(false);
	repackager.repackage(new Libraries() {
				@Override
				public void doWithLibraries(LibraryCallback callback) throws IOException {
					// Build system specific implementation, callback for each dependency
					// callback.library(new Library(nestedFile, LibraryScope.COMPILE));
				}
			});
----



[[build-tool-plugins-whats-next]]
== What to Read Next
If you are interested in how the build tool plugins work, you can look at the {spring-boot-code}/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-tools[`spring-boot-tools`] module on GitHub.
More technical details of the executable jar format are covered in <<appendix-executable-jar-format#executable-jar,the appendix>>.

If you have specific build-related questions, you can check out the "`<<howto.adoc#howto, how-to>>`" guides.
