Spring Boot Starters are a set of convenient dependency descriptors
that you can include in your application. You get a one-stop-shop for
all the Spring and related technology that you need without having to
hunt through sample code and copy paste loads of dependency
descriptors. For example, if you want to get started using Spring and
JPA for database access just include the
`spring-boot-starter-data-jpa` dependency in your project, and you are
good to go.

If you create a starter for a technology that is not already in the standard list we can list it here. Just send a pull request for this page.
