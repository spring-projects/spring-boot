= Testing

Spring Boot includes a number of testing utilities and support classes as well as a dedicated starter that provides common test dependencies.
This section answers common questions about testing.



[[howto.testing.with-spring-security]]
== Testing With Spring Security

Spring Security provides support for running tests as a specific user.
For example, the test in the snippet below will run with an authenticated user that has the `ADMIN` role.

include-code::MySecurityTests[]

Spring Security provides comprehensive integration with Spring MVC Test, and this can also be used when testing controllers using the javadoc:org.springframework.boot.webmvc.test.autoconfigure.WebMvcTest[format=annotation] slice and javadoc:org.springframework.test.web.servlet.MockMvc[].

For additional details on Spring Security's testing support, see Spring Security's {url-spring-security-docs}/servlet/test/index.html[reference documentation].




[[howto.testing.slice-tests]]
== Structure javadoc:org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration[format=annotation] Classes for Inclusion in Slice Tests

Slice tests work by restricting Spring Framework's component scanning to a limited set of components based on their type.
For any beans that are not created through component scanning, for example, beans that are created using the javadoc:org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean[format=annotation] annotation, slice tests will not be able to include/exclude them from the application context.
Consider this example:

include-code::MyConfiguration[]

For a javadoc:org.springframework.boot.webmvc.test.autoconfigure.WebMvcTest[format=annotation] for an application with the above javadoc:org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration[format=annotation] class, you might expect to have the javadoc:org.springframework.security.web.SecurityFilterChain[] bean in the application context so that you can test if your controller endpoints are secured properly.
However, `MyConfiguration` is not picked up by @WebMvcTest's component scanning filter because it doesn't match any of the types specified by the filter.
You can include the configuration explicitly by annotating the test class with `@Import(MyConfiguration.class)`.
This will load all the beans in `MyConfiguration` including the javadoc:com.zaxxer.hikari.HikariDataSource[] bean which isn't required when testing the web tier.
Splitting the configuration class into two will enable importing just the security configuration.

include-code::MySecurityConfiguration[]

include-code::MyDatasourceConfiguration[]

Having a single configuration class can be inefficient when beans from a certain domain need to be included in slice tests.
Instead, structuring the application's configuration as multiple granular classes with beans for a specific domain can enable importing them only for specific slice tests.
