This section includes topics relating to the Docker Compose support in Spring Boot.



[[howto.docker-compose.jdbc-url]]
== Customizing the JDBC URL

When using javadoc:org.springframework.boot.jdbc.autoconfigure.JdbcConnectionDetails[] with Docker Compose, the parameters of the JDBC URL
can be customized by applying the `org.springframework.boot.jdbc.parameters` label to the
service. For example:

[source,yaml]
----
services:
  postgres:
    image: 'postgres:15.3'
    environment:
      - 'POSTGRES_USER=myuser'
      - 'POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secret'
      - 'POSTGRES_DB=mydb'
    ports:
      - '5432:5432'
    labels:
      org.springframework.boot.jdbc.parameters: 'ssl=true&sslmode=require'
----

With this Docker Compose file in place, the JDBC URL used is `jdbc:postgresql://127.0.0.1:5432/mydb?ssl=true&sslmode=require`.



[[howto.docker-compose.sharing-services]]
== Sharing Services Between Multiple Applications

If you want to share services between multiple applications, create the `compose.yaml` file in one of the applications and then use the configuration property configprop:spring.docker.compose.file[] in the other applications to reference the `compose.yaml` file.
You should also set configprop:spring.docker.compose.lifecycle-management[] to `start-only`, as it defaults to `start-and-stop` and stopping one application would shut down the shared services for the other still running applications as well.
Setting it to `start-only` won't stop the shared services on application stop, but a caveat is that if you shut down all applications, the services remain running.
You can stop the services manually by running `docker compose stop` on the command line in the directory which contains the `compose.yaml` file.
