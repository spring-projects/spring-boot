= Data Access

Spring Boot includes a number of starters for working with data sources.
This section answers questions related to doing so.



[[howto.data-access.configure-custom-datasource]]
== Configure a Custom DataSource

To configure your own javadoc:javax.sql.DataSource[], define a javadoc:org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean[format=annotation] of that type in your configuration.
Spring Boot reuses your javadoc:javax.sql.DataSource[] anywhere one is required, including database initialization.
If you need to externalize some settings, you can bind your javadoc:javax.sql.DataSource[] to the environment (see xref:reference:features/external-config.adoc#features.external-config.typesafe-configuration-properties.third-party-configuration[]).

The following example shows how to define a data source in a bean:

include-code::custom/MyDataSourceConfiguration[]

The following example shows how to define a data source by setting its properties:

[configprops%novalidate,yaml]
----
app:
  datasource:
    url: "jdbc:h2:mem:mydb"
    username: "sa"
    pool-size: 30
----

Assuming that `SomeDataSource` has regular JavaBean properties for the URL, the username, and the pool size, these settings are bound automatically before the javadoc:javax.sql.DataSource[] is made available to other components.

Spring Boot also provides a utility builder class, called javadoc:org.springframework.boot.jdbc.DataSourceBuilder[], that can be used to create one of the standard data sources (if it is on the classpath).
The builder can detect which one to use based on what is available on the classpath.
It also auto-detects the driver based on the JDBC URL.

The following example shows how to create a data source by using a javadoc:org.springframework.boot.jdbc.DataSourceBuilder[]:

include-code::builder/MyDataSourceConfiguration[]

To run an app with that javadoc:javax.sql.DataSource[], all you need is the connection information.
Pool-specific settings can also be provided.
Check the implementation that is going to be used at runtime for more details.

The following example shows how to define a JDBC data source by setting properties:

[configprops%novalidate,yaml]
----
app:
  datasource:
    url: "jdbc:mysql://localhost/test"
    username: "dbuser"
    password: "dbpass"
    pool-size: 30
----

However, there is a catch due to the method's javadoc:javax.sql.DataSource[] return type.
This hides the actual type of the connection pool so no configuration property metadata is generated for your custom javadoc:javax.sql.DataSource[] and no auto-completion is available in your IDE.
To address this problem, use the builder's `type(Class)` method to specify the type of javadoc:javax.sql.DataSource[] to be built and update the method's return type.
For example, the following shows how to create a javadoc:com.zaxxer.hikari.HikariDataSource[] with javadoc:org.springframework.boot.jdbc.DataSourceBuilder[]:

include-code::simple/MyDataSourceConfiguration[]

Unfortunately, this basic setup does not work because Hikari has no `url` property.
Instead, it has a `jdbc-url` property which means that you must rewrite your configuration as follows:

[configprops%novalidate,yaml]
----
app:
  datasource:
    jdbc-url: "jdbc:mysql://localhost/test"
    username: "dbuser"
    password: "dbpass"
    pool-size: 30
----

To address this problem, make use of javadoc:org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.jdbc.DataSourceProperties[] which will handle the `url` to `jdbc-url` translation for you.
You can initialize a javadoc:org.springframework.boot.jdbc.DataSourceBuilder[] from the state of any javadoc:org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.jdbc.DataSourceProperties[] object using its `initializeDataSourceBuilder()` method.
You could inject the javadoc:org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.jdbc.DataSourceProperties[] that Spring Boot creates automatically, however, that would split your configuration across `+spring.datasource.*+` and `+app.datasource.*+`.
To avoid this, define a custom javadoc:org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.jdbc.DataSourceProperties[] with a custom configuration properties prefix, as shown in the following example:

include-code::configurable/MyDataSourceConfiguration[]

This setup is equivalent to what Spring Boot does for you by default, except that the pool's type is specified in code and its settings are exposed as `app.datasource.configuration.*` properties.
javadoc:org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.jdbc.DataSourceProperties[] takes care of the `url` to `jdbc-url` translation, so you can configure it as follows:

[configprops%novalidate,yaml]
----
app:
  datasource:
    url: "jdbc:mysql://localhost/test"
    username: "dbuser"
    password: "dbpass"
    configuration:
      maximum-pool-size: 30
----

Note that, as the custom configuration specifies in code that Hikari should be used, `app.datasource.type` will have no effect.

As described in xref:reference:data/sql.adoc#data.sql.datasource.connection-pool[], javadoc:org.springframework.boot.jdbc.DataSourceBuilder[] supports several different connection pools.
To use a pool other than Hikari, add it to the classpath, use the `type(Class)` method to specify the pool class to use, and update the javadoc:org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean[format=annotation] method's return type to match.
This will also provide you with configuration property metadata for the specific connection pool that you've chosen.

TIP: Spring Boot will expose Hikari-specific settings to `spring.datasource.hikari`.
This example uses a more generic `configuration` sub namespace as the example does not support multiple datasource implementations.

See xref:reference:data/sql.adoc#data.sql.datasource[] and the {code-spring-boot-autoconfigure-src}/jdbc/DataSourceAutoConfiguration.java[`DataSourceAutoConfiguration`] class for more details.



[[howto.data-access.configure-two-datasources]]
== Configure Two DataSources

To define an additional javadoc:javax.sql.DataSource[], an approach that's similar to the previous section can be used.
A key difference is that the javadoc:javax.sql.DataSource[] javadoc:org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean[format=annotation] must be declared with `defaultCandidate=false`.
This prevents the auto-configured javadoc:javax.sql.DataSource[] from backing off.

NOTE: The {url-spring-framework-docs}/core/beans/dependencies/factory-autowire.html#beans-factory-autowire-candidate[Spring Framework reference documentation] describes this feature in more details.

To allow the additional javadoc:javax.sql.DataSource[] to be injected where it's needed, also annotate it with javadoc:org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Qualifier[format=annotation] as shown in the following example:

include-code::MyAdditionalDataSourceConfiguration[]

To consume the additional javadoc:javax.sql.DataSource[], annotate the injection point with the same javadoc:org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Qualifier[format=annotation].

The auto-configured and additional data sources can be configured as follows:

[configprops%novalidate,yaml]
----
spring:
  datasource:
    url: "jdbc:mysql://localhost/first"
    username: "dbuser"
    password: "dbpass"
    configuration:
      maximum-pool-size: 30
app:
  datasource:
    url: "jdbc:mysql://localhost/second"
    username: "dbuser"
    password: "dbpass"
    max-total: 30
----

More advanced, implementation-specific, configuration of the auto-configured javadoc:javax.sql.DataSource[] is available through the `spring.datasource.configuration.*` properties.
You can apply the same concept to the additional javadoc:javax.sql.DataSource[] as well, as shown in the following example:

include-code::MyCompleteAdditionalDataSourceConfiguration[]

The preceding example configures the additional data source with the same logic as Spring Boot would use in auto-configuration.
Note that the `app.datasource.configuration.*` properties provide advanced settings based on the chosen implementation.

As with xref:how-to:data-access.adoc#howto.data-access.configure-custom-datasource[configuring a single custom javadoc:javax.sql.DataSource[]], the type of one or both of the javadoc:javax.sql.DataSource[] beans can be customized using the `type(Class)` method on javadoc:org.springframework.boot.jdbc.DataSourceBuilder[].
See xref:reference:data/sql.adoc#data.sql.datasource.connection-pool[] for details of the supported types.



[[howto.data-access.spring-data-repositories]]
== Use Spring Data Repositories

Spring Data can create implementations of javadoc:org.springframework.data.repository.Repository[] interfaces of various flavors.
Spring Boot handles all of that for you, as long as those javadoc:org.springframework.data.repository.Repository[] implementations are included in one of the xref:reference:using/auto-configuration.adoc#using.auto-configuration.packages[auto-configuration packages], typically the package (or a sub-package) of your main application class that is annotated with javadoc:org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication[format=annotation] or javadoc:org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.EnableAutoConfiguration[format=annotation].

For many applications, all you need is to put the right Spring Data dependencies on your classpath.
There is a `spring-boot-starter-data-jpa` for JPA, `spring-boot-starter-data-mongodb` for Mongodb, and various other starters for supported technologies.
To get started, create some repository interfaces to handle your javadoc:jakarta.persistence.Entity[format=annotation] objects.

Spring Boot determines the location of your javadoc:org.springframework.data.repository.Repository[] implementations by scanning the xref:reference:using/auto-configuration.adoc#using.auto-configuration.packages[auto-configuration packages].
For more control, use the `@Enableâ€¦Repositories` annotations from Spring Data.

For more about Spring Data, see the {url-spring-data-site}[Spring Data project page].



[[howto.data-access.separate-entity-definitions-from-spring-configuration]]
== Separate @Entity Definitions from Spring Configuration

Spring Boot determines the location of your javadoc:jakarta.persistence.Entity[format=annotation] definitions by scanning the xref:reference:using/auto-configuration.adoc#using.auto-configuration.packages[auto-configuration packages].
For more control, use the javadoc:org.springframework.boot.persistence.autoconfigure.EntityScan[format=annotation] annotation, as shown in the following example:

include-code::MyApplication[]



[[howto.data-access.filter-scanned-entity-definitions]]
== Filter Scanned @Entity Definitions

It is possible to filter the javadoc:jakarta.persistence.Entity[format=annotation] definitions using a javadoc:org.springframework.orm.jpa.persistenceunit.ManagedClassNameFilter[] bean.
This can be useful in tests when only a sub-set of the available entities should be considered.
In the following example, only entities from the `com.example.app.customer` package are included:

include-code::MyEntityScanConfiguration[]



[[howto.data-access.jpa-properties]]
== Configure JPA Properties

Spring Data JPA already provides some vendor-independent configuration options (such as those for SQL logging), and Spring Boot exposes those options and a few more for Hibernate as external configuration properties.
Some of them are automatically detected according to the context so you should not have to set them.

The `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto` is a special case, because, depending on runtime conditions, it has different defaults.
If an embedded database is used and no schema manager (such as Liquibase or Flyway) is handling the javadoc:javax.sql.DataSource[], it defaults to `create-drop`.
In all other cases, it defaults to `none`.

The dialect to use is detected by the JPA provider.
If you prefer to set the dialect yourself, set the configprop:spring.jpa.database-platform[] property.

The most common options to set are shown in the following example:

[configprops,yaml]
----
spring:
  jpa:
    hibernate:
      naming:
        physical-strategy: "com.example.MyPhysicalNamingStrategy"
    show-sql: true
----

In addition, all properties in `+spring.jpa.properties.*+` are passed through as normal JPA properties (with the prefix stripped) when the local javadoc:jakarta.persistence.EntityManagerFactory[] is created.

[WARNING]
====
You need to ensure that names defined under `+spring.jpa.properties.*+` exactly match those expected by your JPA provider.
Spring Boot will not attempt any kind of relaxed binding for these entries.

For example, if you want to configure Hibernate's batch size you must use `+spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.jdbc.batch_size+`.
If you use other forms, such as `batchSize` or `batch-size`, Hibernate will not apply the setting.
====

TIP: If you need to apply advanced customization to Hibernate properties, consider registering a javadoc:org.springframework.boot.jpa.autoconfigure.hibernate.HibernatePropertiesCustomizer[] bean that will be invoked prior to creating the javadoc:jakarta.persistence.EntityManagerFactory[].
This takes precedence over anything that is applied by the auto-configuration.



[[howto.data-access.configure-hibernate-naming-strategy]]
== Configure Hibernate Naming Strategy

Hibernate uses {url-hibernate-userguide}#naming[two different naming strategies] to map names from the object model to the corresponding database names.
The fully qualified class name of the physical and the implicit strategy implementations can be configured by setting the `spring.jpa.hibernate.naming.physical-strategy` and `spring.jpa.hibernate.naming.implicit-strategy` properties, respectively.
Alternatively, if javadoc:org.hibernate.boot.model.naming.ImplicitNamingStrategy[] or javadoc:org.hibernate.boot.model.naming.PhysicalNamingStrategy[] beans are available in the application context, Hibernate will be automatically configured to use them.

By default, Spring Boot configures the physical naming strategy with javadoc:org.hibernate.boot.model.naming.CamelCaseToUnderscoresNamingStrategy[].
Using this strategy, all dots are replaced by underscores and camel casing is replaced by underscores as well.
Additionally, by default, all table names are generated in lower case.
For example, a `TelephoneNumber` entity is mapped to the `telephone_number` table.
If your schema requires mixed-case identifiers, define a custom javadoc:org.hibernate.boot.model.naming.CamelCaseToUnderscoresNamingStrategy[] bean, as shown in the following example:

include-code::spring/MyHibernateConfiguration[]

If you prefer to use Hibernate's default instead, set the following property:

[configprops,yaml]
----
spring:
  jpa:
    hibernate:
      naming:
        physical-strategy: org.hibernate.boot.model.naming.PhysicalNamingStrategyStandardImpl
----

Alternatively, you can configure the following bean:

include-code::standard/MyHibernateConfiguration[]

See {code-spring-boot-autoconfigure-src}/orm/jpa/HibernateJpaAutoConfiguration.java[`HibernateJpaAutoConfiguration`] and {code-spring-boot-autoconfigure-src}/orm/jpa/JpaBaseConfiguration.java[`JpaBaseConfiguration`] for more details.



[[howto.data-access.configure-hibernate-second-level-caching]]
== Configure Hibernate Second-Level Caching

Hibernate {url-hibernate-userguide}#caching[second-level cache] can be configured for a range of cache providers.
Rather than configuring Hibernate to lookup the cache provider again, it is better to provide the one that is available in the context whenever possible.

To do this with JCache, first make sure that `org.hibernate.orm:hibernate-jcache` is available on the classpath.
Then, add a javadoc:org.springframework.boot.jpa.autoconfigure.hibernate.HibernatePropertiesCustomizer[] bean as shown in the following example:

include-code::MyHibernateSecondLevelCacheConfiguration[]

This customizer will configure Hibernate to use the same javadoc:org.springframework.cache.CacheManager[] as the one that the application uses.
It is also possible to use separate javadoc:org.springframework.cache.CacheManager[] instances.
For details, see {url-hibernate-userguide}#caching-provider-jcache[the Hibernate user guide].



[[howto.data-access.dependency-injection-in-hibernate-components]]
== Use Dependency Injection in Hibernate Components

By default, Spring Boot registers a javadoc:org.hibernate.resource.beans.container.spi.BeanContainer[] implementation that uses the javadoc:org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanFactory[] so that converters and entity listeners can use regular dependency injection.

You can disable or tune this behavior by registering a javadoc:org.springframework.boot.jpa.autoconfigure.hibernate.HibernatePropertiesCustomizer[] that removes or changes the `hibernate.resource.beans.container` property.



[[howto.data-access.use-custom-entity-manager]]
== Use a Custom EntityManagerFactory

To take full control of the configuration of the javadoc:jakarta.persistence.EntityManagerFactory[], you need to add a javadoc:org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean[format=annotation] named '`entityManagerFactory`'.
Spring Boot auto-configuration switches off its entity manager in the presence of a bean of that type.

NOTE: When you create a bean for javadoc:org.springframework.orm.jpa.LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean[] yourself, any customization that was applied during the creation of the auto-configured javadoc:org.springframework.orm.jpa.LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean[] is lost.
Make sure to use the auto-configured javadoc:org.springframework.boot.jpa.EntityManagerFactoryBuilder[] to retain JPA and vendor properties.
This is particularly important if you were relying on `spring.jpa.*` properties for configuring things like the naming strategy or the DDL mode.



[[howto.data-access.use-multiple-entity-managers]]
== Using Multiple EntityManagerFactories

If you need to use JPA against multiple datasources, you likely need one javadoc:jakarta.persistence.EntityManagerFactory[] per datasource.
The javadoc:org.springframework.orm.jpa.LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean[] from Spring ORM allows you to configure an javadoc:jakarta.persistence.EntityManagerFactory[] for your needs.
You can also reuse javadoc:org.springframework.boot.jpa.autoconfigure.JpaProperties[] to bind settings for a second javadoc:jakarta.persistence.EntityManagerFactory[].
Building upon xref:how-to:data-access.adoc#howto.data-access.configure-two-datasources[the example for configuring a second javadoc:javax.sql.DataSource[]], a second javadoc:jakarta.persistence.EntityManagerFactory[] can be defined as shown in the following example:

include-code::MyAdditionalEntityManagerFactoryConfiguration[]

The example above creates an javadoc:jakarta.persistence.EntityManagerFactory[] using the javadoc:javax.sql.DataSource[] bean qualified with `@Qualifier("second")`.
It scans entities located in the same package as `Order`.
It is possible to map additional JPA properties using the `app.jpa` namespace.
The use of `@Bean(defaultCandidate=false)` allows the `secondJpaProperties` and `secondEntityManagerFactory` beans to be defined without interfering with auto-configured beans of the same type.

NOTE: The {url-spring-framework-docs}/core/beans/dependencies/factory-autowire.html#beans-factory-autowire-candidate[Spring Framework reference documentation] describes this feature in more details.

You should provide a similar configuration for any more additional data sources for which you need JPA access.
To complete the picture, you need to configure a javadoc:org.springframework.orm.jpa.JpaTransactionManager[] for each javadoc:jakarta.persistence.EntityManagerFactory[] as well.
Alternatively, you might be able to use a JTA transaction manager that spans both.

If you use Spring Data, you need to configure javadoc:org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.config.EnableJpaRepositories[format=annotation] accordingly, as shown in the following examples:

include-code::OrderConfiguration[]

include-code::CustomerConfiguration[]



[[howto.data-access.use-traditional-persistence-xml]]
== Use a Traditional persistence.xml File

Spring Boot will not search for or use a `META-INF/persistence.xml` by default.
If you prefer to use a traditional `persistence.xml`, you need to define your own javadoc:org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean[format=annotation] of type javadoc:org.springframework.orm.jpa.LocalEntityManagerFactoryBean[] (with an ID of '`entityManagerFactory`') and set the persistence unit name there.

See {code-spring-boot-autoconfigure-src}/orm/jpa/JpaBaseConfiguration.java[`JpaBaseConfiguration`] for the default settings.



[[howto.data-access.use-spring-data-jpa-and-mongo-repositories]]
== Use Spring Data JPA and Mongo Repositories

Spring Data JPA and Spring Data Mongo can both automatically create javadoc:org.springframework.data.repository.Repository[] implementations for you.
If they are both present on the classpath, you might have to do some extra configuration to tell Spring Boot which repositories to create.
The most explicit way to do that is to use the standard Spring Data javadoc:org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.config.EnableJpaRepositories[format=annotation] and javadoc:org.springframework.data.mongodb.repository.config.EnableMongoRepositories[format=annotation] annotations and provide the location of your javadoc:org.springframework.data.repository.Repository[] interfaces.

There are also flags (`+spring.data.*.repositories.enabled+` and `+spring.data.*.repositories.type+`) that you can use to switch the auto-configured repositories on and off in external configuration.
Doing so is useful, for instance, in case you want to switch off the Mongo repositories and still use the auto-configured javadoc:org.springframework.data.mongodb.core.MongoTemplate[].

The same obstacle and the same features exist for other auto-configured Spring Data repository types (Elasticsearch, Redis, and others).
To work with them, change the names of the annotations and flags accordingly.



[[howto.data-access.customize-spring-data-web-support]]
== Customize Spring Data's Web Support

Spring Data provides web support that simplifies the use of Spring Data repositories in a web application.
Spring Boot provides properties in the `spring.data.web` namespace for customizing its configuration.
Note that if you are using Spring Data REST, you must use the properties in the `spring.data.rest` namespace instead.



[[howto.data-access.exposing-spring-data-repositories-as-rest]]
== Expose Spring Data Repositories as REST Endpoint

Spring Data REST can expose the javadoc:org.springframework.data.repository.Repository[] implementations as REST endpoints for you,
provided Spring MVC has been enabled for the application.

Spring Boot exposes a set of useful properties (from the `spring.data.rest` namespace) that customize the javadoc:org.springframework.data.rest.core.config.RepositoryRestConfiguration[].
If you need to provide additional customization, you should use a javadoc:org.springframework.data.rest.webmvc.config.RepositoryRestConfigurer[] bean.

NOTE: If you do not specify any order on your custom javadoc:org.springframework.data.rest.webmvc.config.RepositoryRestConfigurer[], it runs after the one Spring Boot uses internally.
If you need to specify an order, make sure it is higher than 0.



[[howto.data-access.configure-a-component-that-is-used-by-jpa]]
== Configure a Component that is Used by JPA

If you want to configure a component that JPA uses, then you need to ensure that the component is initialized before JPA.
When the component is auto-configured, Spring Boot takes care of this for you.
For example, when Flyway is auto-configured, Hibernate is configured to depend on Flyway so that Flyway has a chance to initialize the database before Hibernate tries to use it.

If you are configuring a component yourself, you can use an javadoc:org.springframework.boot.jpa.autoconfigure.EntityManagerFactoryDependsOnPostProcessor[] subclass as a convenient way of setting up the necessary dependencies.
For example, if you use Hibernate Search with Elasticsearch as its index manager, any javadoc:jakarta.persistence.EntityManagerFactory[] beans must be configured to depend on the `elasticsearchClient` bean, as shown in the following example:

include-code::ElasticsearchEntityManagerFactoryDependsOnPostProcessor[]



[[howto.data-access.configure-jooq-with-multiple-datasources]]
== Configure jOOQ with Two DataSources

If you need to use jOOQ with multiple data sources, you should create your own javadoc:org.jooq.DSLContext[] for each one.
See {code-spring-boot-autoconfigure-src}/jooq/JooqAutoConfiguration.java[`JooqAutoConfiguration`] for more details.

TIP: In particular, javadoc:org.springframework.boot.jooq.autoconfigure.ExceptionTranslatorExecuteListener[] and javadoc:org.springframework.boot.jooq.autoconfigure.SpringTransactionProvider[] can be reused to provide similar features to what the auto-configuration does with a single javadoc:javax.sql.DataSource[].
