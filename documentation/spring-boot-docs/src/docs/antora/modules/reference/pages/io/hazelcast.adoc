[[io.hazelcast]]
= Hazelcast

If https://hazelcast.com/[Hazelcast] is on the classpath and a suitable configuration is found, Spring Boot auto-configures a javadoc:com.hazelcast.core.HazelcastInstance[] that you can inject in your application.

Spring Boot first attempts to create a client by checking the following configuration options:

* The presence of a javadoc:com.hazelcast.client.config.ClientConfig[] bean.
* A configuration file defined by the configprop:spring.hazelcast.config[] property.
* The presence of the `hazelcast.client.config` system property.
* A `hazelcast-client.xml` in the working directory or at the root of the classpath.
* A `hazelcast-client.yaml` (or `hazelcast-client.yml`) in the working directory or at the root of the classpath.

If a client can not be created, Spring Boot attempts to configure an embedded server.
If you define a javadoc:com.hazelcast.config.Config[] bean, Spring Boot uses that.
If your configuration defines an instance name, Spring Boot tries to locate an existing instance rather than creating a new one.

You could also specify the Hazelcast configuration file to use through configuration, as shown in the following example:

[configprops,yaml]
----
spring:
  hazelcast:
    config: "classpath:config/my-hazelcast.xml"
----

Otherwise, Spring Boot tries to find the Hazelcast configuration from the default locations: `hazelcast.xml` in the working directory or at the root of the classpath, or a YAML counterpart in the same locations.
We also check if the `hazelcast.config` system property is set.
See the https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/manual/html-single/[Hazelcast documentation] for more details.

TIP: By default, javadoc:com.hazelcast.spring.context.SpringAware[format=annotation] on Hazelcast components is supported.
The javadoc:com.hazelcast.core.ManagedContext[] can be overridden by declaring a javadoc:org.springframework.boot.hazelcast.autoconfigure.HazelcastConfigCustomizer[] bean with an javadoc:org.springframework.core.annotation.Order[format=annotation] higher than zero.

NOTE: Spring Boot also has xref:io/caching.adoc#io.caching.provider.hazelcast[explicit caching support for Hazelcast].
If caching is enabled, the javadoc:com.hazelcast.core.HazelcastInstance[] is automatically wrapped in a javadoc:org.springframework.cache.CacheManager[] implementation.
