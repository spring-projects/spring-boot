[[data.nosql]]
= Working with NoSQL Technologies

Spring Data provides additional projects that help you access a variety of NoSQL technologies, including:

* {url-spring-data-cassandra-site}[Cassandra]
* {url-spring-data-couchbase-site}[Couchbase]
* {url-spring-data-elasticsearch-site}[Elasticsearch]
* {url-spring-data-geode-site}[Geode]
* {url-spring-data-ldap-site}[LDAP]
* {url-spring-data-mongodb-site}[MongoDB]
* {url-spring-data-neo4j-site}[Neo4J]
* {url-spring-data-redis-site}[Redis]

Of these, Spring Boot provides auto-configuration for Cassandra, Couchbase, Elasticsearch, LDAP, MongoDB, Neo4J and Redis.
Additionally, {url-spring-boot-for-apache-geode-site}[Spring Boot for Apache Geode] provides {url-spring-boot-for-apache-geode-docs}#geode-repositories[auto-configuration for Apache Geode].
You can make use of the other projects, but you must configure them yourself.
See the appropriate reference documentation at {url-spring-data-site}.

Spring Boot also provides auto-configuration for the InfluxDB client but it is deprecated in favor of https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb-client-java[the new InfluxDB Java client] that provides its own Spring Boot integration.



[[data.nosql.redis]]
== Redis

https://redis.io/[Redis] is a cache, message broker, and richly-featured key-value store.
Spring Boot offers basic auto-configuration for the https://github.com/lettuce-io/lettuce-core/[Lettuce] and https://github.com/xetorthio/jedis/[Jedis] client libraries and the abstractions on top of them provided by https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-redis[Spring Data Redis].

There is a `spring-boot-starter-data-redis` starter for collecting the dependencies in a convenient way.
By default, it uses https://github.com/lettuce-io/lettuce-core/[Lettuce].
That starter handles both traditional and reactive applications.

TIP: We also provide a `spring-boot-starter-data-redis-reactive` starter for consistency with the other stores with reactive support.



[[data.nosql.redis.connecting]]
=== Connecting to Redis

You can inject an auto-configured javadoc:org.springframework.data.redis.connection.RedisConnectionFactory[], javadoc:org.springframework.data.redis.core.StringRedisTemplate[], or vanilla javadoc:org.springframework.data.redis.core.RedisTemplate[] instance as you would any other Spring Bean.
The following listing shows an example of such a bean:

include-code::MyBean[]

By default, the instance tries to connect to a Redis server at `localhost:6379`.
You can specify custom connection details using `spring.data.redis.*` properties, as shown in the following example:

[configprops,yaml]
----
spring:
  data:
    redis:
      host: "localhost"
      port: 6379
      database: 0
      username: "user"
      password: "secret"
----

You can also specify the url of the Redis server directly.
When setting the url, the host, port, username and password properties are ignored.
This is shown in the following example:

[configprops,yaml]
----
spring:
  data:
    redis:
      url: "redis://user:secret@localhost:6379"
      database: 0
----


TIP: You can also register an arbitrary number of beans that implement javadoc:org.springframework.boot.data.redis.autoconfigure.LettuceClientConfigurationBuilderCustomizer[] for more advanced customizations.
javadoc:io.lettuce.core.resource.ClientResources[] can also be customized using javadoc:org.springframework.boot.data.redis.autoconfigure.ClientResourcesBuilderCustomizer[].
If you use Jedis, javadoc:org.springframework.boot.data.redis.autoconfigure.JedisClientConfigurationBuilderCustomizer[] is also available.
Alternatively, you can register a bean of type javadoc:org.springframework.data.redis.connection.RedisStandaloneConfiguration[], javadoc:org.springframework.data.redis.connection.RedisSentinelConfiguration[], or javadoc:org.springframework.data.redis.connection.RedisClusterConfiguration[] to take full control over the configuration.

If you add your own javadoc:org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean[format=annotation] of any of the auto-configured types, it replaces the default (except in the case of javadoc:org.springframework.data.redis.core.RedisTemplate[], when the exclusion is based on the bean name, `redisTemplate`, not its type).

By default, a pooled connection factory is auto-configured if `commons-pool2` is on the classpath.

The auto-configured javadoc:org.springframework.data.redis.connection.RedisConnectionFactory[] can be configured to use SSL for communication with the server by setting the properties as shown in this example:

[configprops,yaml]
----
spring:
  data:
    redis:
      ssl:
        enabled: true
----

Custom SSL trust material can be configured in an xref:features/ssl.adoc[SSL bundle] and applied to the javadoc:org.springframework.data.redis.connection.RedisConnectionFactory[] as shown in this example:

[configprops,yaml]
----
spring:
  data:
    redis:
      ssl:
        bundle: "example"
----



[[data.nosql.mongodb]]
== MongoDB

https://www.mongodb.com/[MongoDB] is an open-source NoSQL document database that uses a JSON-like schema instead of traditional table-based relational data.
Spring Boot offers several conveniences for working with MongoDB, including the `spring-boot-starter-data-mongodb` and `spring-boot-starter-data-mongodb-reactive` starters.



[[data.nosql.mongodb.connecting]]
=== Connecting to a MongoDB Database

To access MongoDB databases, you can inject an auto-configured javadoc:org.springframework.data.mongodb.MongoDatabaseFactory[].
By default, the instance tries to connect to a MongoDB server at `mongodb://localhost/test`.
The following example shows how to connect to a MongoDB database:

include-code::MyBean[]

If you have defined your own javadoc:{url-mongodb-driver-sync-javadoc}/com.mongodb.client.MongoClient[], it will be used to auto-configure a suitable javadoc:org.springframework.data.mongodb.MongoDatabaseFactory[].

The auto-configured javadoc:{url-mongodb-driver-sync-javadoc}/com.mongodb.client.MongoClient[] is created using a javadoc:{url-mongodb-driver-core-javadoc}/com.mongodb.MongoClientSettings[] bean.
If you have defined your own javadoc:{url-mongodb-driver-core-javadoc}/com.mongodb.MongoClientSettings[], it will be used without modification and the `spring.data.mongodb` properties will be ignored.
Otherwise a javadoc:{url-mongodb-driver-core-javadoc}/com.mongodb.MongoClientSettings[] will be auto-configured and will have the `spring.data.mongodb` properties applied to it.
In either case, you can declare one or more javadoc:org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.mongo.MongoClientSettingsBuilderCustomizer[] beans to fine-tune the javadoc:{url-mongodb-driver-core-javadoc}/com.mongodb.MongoClientSettings[] configuration.
Each will be called in order with the javadoc:{url-mongodb-driver-core-javadoc}/com.mongodb.MongoClientSettings$Builder[] that is used to build the javadoc:{url-mongodb-driver-core-javadoc}/com.mongodb.MongoClientSettings[].

You can set the configprop:spring.data.mongodb.uri[] property to change the URL and configure additional settings such as the _replica set_, as shown in the following example:

[configprops,yaml]
----
spring:
  data:
    mongodb:
      uri: "mongodb://user:secret@mongoserver1.example.com:27017,mongoserver2.example.com:23456/test"
----

Alternatively, you can specify connection details using discrete properties.
For example, you might declare the following settings in your `application.properties`:

[configprops,yaml]
----
spring:
  data:
    mongodb:
      host: "mongoserver1.example.com"
      port: 27017
      additional-hosts:
      - "mongoserver2.example.com:23456"
      database: "test"
      username: "user"
      password: "secret"
----

The auto-configured javadoc:{url-mongodb-driver-sync-javadoc}/com.mongodb.client.MongoClient[] can be configured to use SSL for communication with the server by setting the properties as shown in this example:

[configprops,yaml]
----
spring:
  data:
    mongodb:
      uri: "mongodb://user:secret@mongoserver1.example.com:27017,mongoserver2.example.com:23456/test"
      ssl:
        enabled: true
----

Custom SSL trust material can be configured in an xref:features/ssl.adoc[SSL bundle] and applied to the javadoc:{url-mongodb-driver-sync-javadoc}/com.mongodb.client.MongoClient[] as shown in this example:

[configprops,yaml]
----
spring:
  data:
    mongodb:
      uri: "mongodb://user:secret@mongoserver1.example.com:27017,mongoserver2.example.com:23456/test"
      ssl:
        bundle: "example"
----


[TIP]
====
If `spring.data.mongodb.port` is not specified, the default of `27017` is used.
You could delete this line from the example shown earlier.

You can also specify the port as part of the host address by using the `host:port` syntax.
This format should be used if you need to change the port of an `additional-hosts` entry.
====

TIP: If you do not use Spring Data MongoDB, you can inject a javadoc:{url-mongodb-driver-sync-javadoc}/com.mongodb.client.MongoClient[] bean instead of using javadoc:org.springframework.data.mongodb.MongoDatabaseFactory[].
If you want to take complete control of establishing the MongoDB connection, you can also declare your own javadoc:org.springframework.data.mongodb.MongoDatabaseFactory[] or javadoc:{url-mongodb-driver-sync-javadoc}/com.mongodb.client.MongoClient[] bean.

NOTE: If you are using the reactive driver, Netty is required for SSL.
The auto-configuration configures this factory automatically if Netty is available and the factory to use has not been customized already.



[[data.nosql.mongodb.template]]
=== MongoTemplate

{url-spring-data-mongodb-site}[Spring Data MongoDB] provides a javadoc:org.springframework.data.mongodb.core.MongoTemplate[] class that is very similar in its design to Spring's javadoc:org.springframework.jdbc.core.JdbcTemplate[].
As with javadoc:org.springframework.jdbc.core.JdbcTemplate[], Spring Boot auto-configures a bean for you to inject the template, as follows:

include-code::MyBean[]

See the javadoc:org.springframework.data.mongodb.core.MongoOperations[] API documentation for complete details.



[[data.nosql.mongodb.repositories]]
=== Spring Data MongoDB Repositories

Spring Data includes repository support for MongoDB.
As with the JPA repositories discussed earlier, the basic principle is that queries are constructed automatically, based on method names.

In fact, both Spring Data JPA and Spring Data MongoDB share the same common infrastructure.
You could take the JPA example from earlier and, assuming that `City` is now a MongoDB data class rather than a JPA javadoc:jakarta.persistence.Entity[format=annotation], it works in the same way, as shown in the following example:

include-code::CityRepository[]

Repositories and documents are found through scanning.
By default, the xref:using/auto-configuration.adoc#using.auto-configuration.packages[auto-configuration packages] are scanned.
You can customize the locations to look for repositories and documents by using javadoc:org.springframework.data.mongodb.repository.config.EnableMongoRepositories[format=annotation] and javadoc:org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.domain.EntityScan[format=annotation] respectively.

TIP: For complete details of Spring Data MongoDB, including its rich object mapping technologies, see its {url-spring-data-mongodb-docs}[reference documentation].



[[data.nosql.neo4j]]
== Neo4j

https://neo4j.com/[Neo4j] is an open-source NoSQL graph database that uses a rich data model of nodes connected by first class relationships, which is better suited for connected big data than traditional RDBMS approaches.
Spring Boot offers several conveniences for working with Neo4j, including the `spring-boot-starter-data-neo4j` starter.



[[data.nosql.neo4j.connecting]]
=== Connecting to a Neo4j Database

To access a Neo4j server, you can inject an auto-configured javadoc:org.neo4j.driver.Driver[].
By default, the instance tries to connect to a Neo4j server at `localhost:7687` using the Bolt protocol.
The following example shows how to inject a Neo4j javadoc:org.neo4j.driver.Driver[] that gives you access, amongst other things, to a javadoc:org.neo4j.driver.Session[]:

include-code::MyBean[]

You can configure various aspects of the driver using `spring.neo4j.*` properties.
The following example shows how to configure the uri and credentials to use:

[configprops,yaml]
----
spring:
  neo4j:
    uri: "bolt://my-server:7687"
    authentication:
      username: "neo4j"
      password: "secret"
----

The auto-configured javadoc:org.neo4j.driver.Driver[] is created using `org.neo4j.driver.Config$ConfigBuilder`.
To fine-tune its configuration, declare one or more javadoc:org.springframework.boot.neo4j.autoconfigure.ConfigBuilderCustomizer[] beans.
Each will be called in order with the `org.neo4j.driver.Config$ConfigBuilder` that is used to build the javadoc:org.neo4j.driver.Driver[].



[[data.nosql.neo4j.repositories]]
=== Spring Data Neo4j Repositories

Spring Data includes repository support for Neo4j.
For complete details of Spring Data Neo4j, see the {url-spring-data-neo4j-docs}[reference documentation].

Spring Data Neo4j shares the common infrastructure with Spring Data JPA as many other Spring Data modules do.
You could take the JPA example from earlier and define `City` as Spring Data Neo4j javadoc:org.springframework.data.neo4j.core.schema.Node[format=annotation] rather than JPA javadoc:jakarta.persistence.Entity[format=annotation] and the repository abstraction works in the same way, as shown in the following example:

include-code::CityRepository[]

The `spring-boot-starter-data-neo4j` starter enables the repository support as well as transaction management.
Spring Boot supports both classic and reactive Neo4j repositories, using the javadoc:org.springframework.data.neo4j.core.Neo4jTemplate[] or javadoc:org.springframework.data.neo4j.core.ReactiveNeo4jTemplate[] beans.
When Project Reactor is available on the classpath, the reactive style is also auto-configured.

Repositories and entities are found through scanning.
By default, the xref:using/auto-configuration.adoc#using.auto-configuration.packages[auto-configuration packages] are scanned.
You can customize the locations to look for repositories and entities by using javadoc:org.springframework.data.neo4j.repository.config.EnableNeo4jRepositories[format=annotation] and javadoc:org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.domain.EntityScan[format=annotation] respectively.

[NOTE]
====
In an application using the reactive style, a javadoc:org.springframework.transaction.ReactiveTransactionManager[] is not auto-configured.
To enable transaction management, the following bean must be defined in your configuration:

include-code::MyNeo4jConfiguration[]
====



[[data.nosql.elasticsearch]]
== Elasticsearch

https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch[Elasticsearch] is an open source, distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine.
Spring Boot offers basic auto-configuration for Elasticsearch clients.

Spring Boot supports several clients:

* The official low-level REST client
* The official Java API client
* The javadoc:org.springframework.data.elasticsearch.client.elc.ReactiveElasticsearchClient[] provided by Spring Data Elasticsearch

Spring Boot provides a dedicated starter, `spring-boot-starter-data-elasticsearch`.



[[data.nosql.elasticsearch.connecting-using-rest]]
=== Connecting to Elasticsearch Using REST clients

Elasticsearch ships two different REST clients that you can use to query a cluster: the https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/java-api-client/current/java-rest-low.html[low-level client] from the `org.elasticsearch.client:elasticsearch-rest-client` module and the https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/java-api-client/current/index.html[Java API client] from the `co.elastic.clients:elasticsearch-java` module.
Additionally, Spring Boot provides support for a reactive client from the `org.springframework.data:spring-data-elasticsearch` module.
By default, the clients will target `http://localhost:9200`.
You can use `spring.elasticsearch.*` properties to further tune how the clients are configured, as shown in the following example:

[configprops,yaml]
----
spring:
  elasticsearch:
    uris: "https://search.example.com:9200"
    socket-timeout: "10s"
    username: "user"
    password: "secret"
----



[[data.nosql.elasticsearch.connecting-using-rest.restclient]]
==== Connecting to Elasticsearch Using RestClient

If you have `elasticsearch-rest-client` on the classpath, Spring Boot will auto-configure and register a javadoc:org.springframework.web.client.RestClient[] bean.
In addition to the properties described previously, to fine-tune the javadoc:org.springframework.web.client.RestClient[] you can register an arbitrary number of beans that implement javadoc:org.springframework.boot.elasticsearch.autoconfigure.RestClientBuilderCustomizer[] for more advanced customizations.
To take full control over the clients' configuration, define a javadoc:org.elasticsearch.client.RestClientBuilder[] bean.



Additionally, if `elasticsearch-rest-client-sniffer` is on the classpath, a javadoc:org.elasticsearch.client.sniff.Sniffer[] is auto-configured to automatically discover nodes from a running Elasticsearch cluster and set them on the javadoc:org.springframework.web.client.RestClient[] bean.
You can further tune how javadoc:org.elasticsearch.client.sniff.Sniffer[] is configured, as shown in the following example:

[configprops,yaml]
----
spring:
  elasticsearch:
    restclient:
      sniffer:
        interval: "10m"
        delay-after-failure: "30s"
----



[[data.nosql.elasticsearch.connecting-using-rest.javaapiclient]]
==== Connecting to Elasticsearch Using ElasticsearchClient

If you have `co.elastic.clients:elasticsearch-java` on the classpath, Spring Boot will auto-configure and register an javadoc:co.elastic.clients.elasticsearch.ElasticsearchClient[] bean.

The javadoc:co.elastic.clients.elasticsearch.ElasticsearchClient[] uses a transport that depends upon the previously described javadoc:org.springframework.web.client.RestClient[].
Therefore, the properties described previously can be used to configure the javadoc:co.elastic.clients.elasticsearch.ElasticsearchClient[].
Furthermore, you can define a javadoc:co.elastic.clients.transport.rest_client.RestClientOptions[] bean to take further control of the behavior of the transport.



[[data.nosql.elasticsearch.connecting-using-rest.reactiveclient]]
==== Connecting to Elasticsearch using ReactiveElasticsearchClient

{url-spring-data-elasticsearch-site}[Spring Data Elasticsearch] ships javadoc:org.springframework.data.elasticsearch.client.elc.ReactiveElasticsearchClient[] for querying Elasticsearch instances in a reactive fashion.
If you have Spring Data Elasticsearch and Reactor on the classpath, Spring Boot will auto-configure and register a javadoc:org.springframework.data.elasticsearch.client.elc.ReactiveElasticsearchClient[].

The javadoc:org.springframework.data.elasticsearch.client.elc.ReactiveElasticsearchClient[] uses a transport that depends upon the previously described javadoc:org.springframework.web.client.RestClient[].
Therefore, the properties described previously can be used to configure the javadoc:org.springframework.data.elasticsearch.client.elc.ReactiveElasticsearchClient[].
Furthermore, you can define a javadoc:co.elastic.clients.transport.rest_client.RestClientOptions[] bean to take further control of the behavior of the transport.



[[data.nosql.elasticsearch.connecting-using-spring-data]]
=== Connecting to Elasticsearch by Using Spring Data

To connect to Elasticsearch, an javadoc:co.elastic.clients.elasticsearch.ElasticsearchClient[] bean must be defined,
auto-configured by Spring Boot or manually provided by the application (see previous sections).
With this configuration in place, an
javadoc:org.springframework.data.elasticsearch.client.elc.ElasticsearchTemplate[] can be injected like any other Spring bean,
as shown in the following example:

include-code::MyBean[]

In the presence of `spring-data-elasticsearch` and Reactor, Spring Boot can also auto-configure a xref:data/nosql.adoc#data.nosql.elasticsearch.connecting-using-rest.reactiveclient[`ReactiveElasticsearchClient`] and a javadoc:org.springframework.data.elasticsearch.client.elc.ReactiveElasticsearchTemplate[] as beans.
They are the reactive equivalent of the other REST clients.



[[data.nosql.elasticsearch.repositories]]
=== Spring Data Elasticsearch Repositories

Spring Data includes repository support for Elasticsearch.
As with the JPA repositories discussed earlier, the basic principle is that queries are constructed for you automatically based on method names.

In fact, both Spring Data JPA and Spring Data Elasticsearch share the same common infrastructure.
You could take the JPA example from earlier and, assuming that `City` is now an Elasticsearch javadoc:org.springframework.data.elasticsearch.annotations.Document[format=annotation] class rather than a JPA javadoc:jakarta.persistence.Entity[format=annotation], it works in the same way.

Repositories and documents are found through scanning.
By default, the xref:using/auto-configuration.adoc#using.auto-configuration.packages[auto-configuration packages] are scanned.
You can customize the locations to look for repositories and documents by using javadoc:org.springframework.data.elasticsearch.repository.config.EnableElasticsearchRepositories[format=annotation] and javadoc:org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.domain.EntityScan[format=annotation] respectively.

TIP: For complete details of Spring Data Elasticsearch, see the {url-spring-data-elasticsearch-docs}[reference documentation].

Spring Boot supports both classic and reactive Elasticsearch repositories, using the javadoc:org.springframework.data.elasticsearch.client.elc.ElasticsearchTemplate[] or javadoc:org.springframework.data.elasticsearch.client.elc.ReactiveElasticsearchTemplate[] beans.
Most likely those beans are auto-configured by Spring Boot given the required dependencies are present.

If you wish to use your own template for backing the Elasticsearch repositories, you can add your own javadoc:org.springframework.data.elasticsearch.client.elc.ElasticsearchTemplate[] or javadoc:org.springframework.data.elasticsearch.core.ElasticsearchOperations[] javadoc:org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean[format=annotation], as long as it is named `"elasticsearchTemplate"`.
Same applies to javadoc:org.springframework.data.elasticsearch.client.elc.ReactiveElasticsearchTemplate[] and javadoc:org.springframework.data.elasticsearch.core.ReactiveElasticsearchOperations[], with the bean name `"reactiveElasticsearchTemplate"`.

You can choose to disable the repositories support with the following property:

[configprops,yaml]
----
    spring:
      data:
        elasticsearch:
          repositories:
            enabled: false
----



[[data.nosql.cassandra]]
== Cassandra

https://cassandra.apache.org/[Cassandra] is an open source, distributed database management system designed to handle large amounts of data across many commodity servers.
Spring Boot offers auto-configuration for Cassandra and the abstractions on top of it provided by {url-spring-data-cassandra-site}[Spring Data Cassandra].
There is a `spring-boot-starter-data-cassandra` starter for collecting the dependencies in a convenient way.



[[data.nosql.cassandra.connecting]]
=== Connecting to Cassandra

You can inject an auto-configured javadoc:org.springframework.data.cassandra.core.cql.CqlTemplate[], javadoc:org.springframework.data.cassandra.core.CassandraTemplate[], or a Cassandra `CqlSession` instance as you would with any other Spring Bean.
The `spring.cassandra.*` properties can be used to customize the connection.
Generally, you provide `keyspace-name` and `contact-points` as well the local datacenter name, as shown in the following example:

[configprops,yaml]
----
spring:
  cassandra:
    keyspace-name: "mykeyspace"
    contact-points: "cassandrahost1:9042,cassandrahost2:9042"
    local-datacenter: "datacenter1"
----

If the port is the same for all your contact points you can use a shortcut and only specify the host names, as shown in the following example:

[configprops,yaml]
----
spring:
  cassandra:
    keyspace-name: "mykeyspace"
    contact-points: "cassandrahost1,cassandrahost2"
    local-datacenter: "datacenter1"
----

TIP: Those two examples are identical as the port default to `9042`.
If you need to configure the port, use `spring.cassandra.port`.

The auto-configured `CqlSession` can be configured to use SSL for communication with the server by setting the properties as shown in this example:

[configprops,yaml]
----
spring:
  cassandra:
    keyspace-name: "mykeyspace"
    contact-points: "cassandrahost1,cassandrahost2"
    local-datacenter: "datacenter1"
    ssl:
      enabled: true
----

Custom SSL trust material can be configured in an xref:features/ssl.adoc[SSL bundle] and applied to the `CqlSession` as shown in this example:

[configprops,yaml]
----
spring:
  cassandra:
    keyspace-name: "mykeyspace"
    contact-points: "cassandrahost1,cassandrahost2"
    local-datacenter: "datacenter1"
    ssl:
      bundle: "example"
----


[NOTE]
====
The Cassandra driver has its own configuration infrastructure that loads an `application.conf` at the root of the classpath.

Spring Boot does not look for such a file by default but can load one using `spring.cassandra.config`.
If a property is both present in `+spring.cassandra.*+` and the configuration file, the value in `+spring.cassandra.*+` takes precedence.

For more advanced driver customizations, you can register an arbitrary number of beans that implement javadoc:org.springframework.boot.cassandra.autoconfigure.DriverConfigLoaderBuilderCustomizer[].
The `CqlSession` can be customized with a bean of type javadoc:org.springframework.boot.cassandra.autoconfigure.CqlSessionBuilderCustomizer[].
====

NOTE: If you use `CqlSessionBuilder` to create multiple `CqlSession` beans, keep in mind the builder is mutable so make sure to inject a fresh copy for each session.

The following code listing shows how to inject a Cassandra bean:

include-code::MyBean[]

If you add your own javadoc:org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean[format=annotation] of type javadoc:org.springframework.data.cassandra.core.CassandraTemplate[], it replaces the default.



[[data.nosql.cassandra.repositories]]
=== Spring Data Cassandra Repositories

Spring Data includes basic repository support for Cassandra.
Currently, this is more limited than the JPA repositories discussed earlier and needs javadoc:org.springframework.data.cassandra.repository.Query[format=annotation] annotated finder methods.

Repositories and entities are found through scanning.
By default, the xref:using/auto-configuration.adoc#using.auto-configuration.packages[auto-configuration packages] are scanned.
You can customize the locations to look for repositories and entities by using javadoc:org.springframework.data.cassandra.repository.config.EnableCassandraRepositories[format=annotation] and javadoc:org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.domain.EntityScan[format=annotation] respectively.

TIP: For complete details of Spring Data Cassandra, see the {url-spring-data-cassandra-docs}[reference documentation].



[[data.nosql.couchbase]]
== Couchbase

https://www.couchbase.com/[Couchbase] is an open-source, distributed, multi-model NoSQL document-oriented database that is optimized for interactive applications.
Spring Boot offers auto-configuration for Couchbase and the abstractions on top of it provided by https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-couchbase[Spring Data Couchbase].
There are `spring-boot-starter-data-couchbase` and `spring-boot-starter-data-couchbase-reactive` starters for collecting the dependencies in a convenient way.



[[data.nosql.couchbase.connecting]]
=== Connecting to Couchbase

You can get a javadoc:com.couchbase.client.java.Cluster[] by adding the Couchbase SDK and some configuration.
The `spring.couchbase.*` properties can be used to customize the connection.
Generally, you provide the https://docs.couchbase.com/dotnet-sdk/current/howtos/managing-connections.html[connection string] and credentials for authentication. Basic authentication with username and password can be configured as shown in the following example:

[configprops,yaml]
----
spring:
  couchbase:
    connection-string: "couchbase://192.168.1.123"
    username: "user"
    password: "secret"
----

https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/manage/manage-security/configure-client-certificates.html[Client certificates] can be used for authentication instead of username and password.
The location and password for a Java KeyStore containing client certificates can be configured as shown in the following example:

[configprops,yaml]
----
spring:
  couchbase:
    connection-string: "couchbase://192.168.1.123"
    env:
      ssl:
        enabled: true
    authentication:
      jks:
        location: "classpath:client.p12"
        password: "secret"
----

PEM-encoded certificates and a private key can be configured as shown in the following example:

[configprops,yaml]
----
spring:
  couchbase:
    connection-string: "couchbase://192.168.1.123"
    env:
      ssl:
        enabled: true
    authentication:
      pem:
        certificates: "classpath:client.crt"
        private-key: "classpath:client.key"
----

It is also possible to customize some of the javadoc:com.couchbase.client.java.env.ClusterEnvironment[] settings.
For instance, the following configuration changes the timeout to open a new javadoc:com.couchbase.client.java.Bucket[] and enables SSL support with a reference to a configured xref:features/ssl.adoc[SSL bundle]:

[configprops,yaml]
----
spring:
  couchbase:
    env:
      timeouts:
        connect: "3s"
      ssl:

TIP: Check the `spring.couchbase.env.*` properties for more details.
To take more control, one or more javadoc:org.springframework.boot.couchbase.autoconfigure.ClusterEnvironmentBuilderCustomizer[] beans can be used.



[[data.nosql.couchbase.repositories]]
=== Spring Data Couchbase Repositories

Spring Data includes repository support for Couchbase.

Repositories and documents are found through scanning.
By default, the xref:using/auto-configuration.adoc#using.auto-configuration.packages[auto-configuration packages] are scanned.
You can customize the locations to look for repositories and documents by using javadoc:org.springframework.data.couchbase.repository.config.EnableCouchbaseRepositories[format=annotation] and javadoc:org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.domain.EntityScan[format=annotation] respectively.

For complete details of Spring Data Couchbase, see the {url-spring-data-couchbase-docs}[reference documentation].

You can inject an auto-configured javadoc:org.springframework.data.couchbase.core.CouchbaseTemplate[] instance as you would with any other Spring Bean, provided a javadoc:org.springframework.data.couchbase.CouchbaseClientFactory[] bean is available.
This happens when a javadoc:com.couchbase.client.java.Cluster[] is available, as described above, and a bucket name has been specified:

[configprops,yaml]
----
spring:
  data:
    couchbase:
      bucket-name: "my-bucket"
----

The following examples shows how to inject a javadoc:org.springframework.data.couchbase.core.CouchbaseTemplate[] bean:

include-code::MyBean[]

There are a few beans that you can define in your own configuration to override those provided by the auto-configuration:

* A javadoc:org.springframework.data.couchbase.core.mapping.CouchbaseMappingContext[] javadoc:org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean[format=annotation] with a name of `couchbaseMappingContext`.
* A javadoc:org.springframework.data.convert.CustomConversions[] javadoc:org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean[format=annotation] with a name of `couchbaseCustomConversions`.
* A javadoc:org.springframework.data.couchbase.core.CouchbaseTemplate[] javadoc:org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean[format=annotation] with a name of `couchbaseTemplate`.

To avoid hard-coding those names in your own config, you can reuse javadoc:org.springframework.data.couchbase.config.BeanNames[] provided by Spring Data Couchbase.
For instance, you can customize the converters to use, as follows:

include-code::MyCouchbaseConfiguration[]



[[data.nosql.ldap]]
== LDAP

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol[LDAP] (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) is an open, vendor-neutral, industry standard application protocol for accessing and maintaining distributed directory information services over an IP network.
Spring Boot offers auto-configuration for any compliant LDAP server as well as support for the embedded in-memory LDAP server from https://ldap.com/unboundid-ldap-sdk-for-java/[UnboundID].

LDAP abstractions are provided by https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-ldap[Spring Data LDAP].
There is a `spring-boot-starter-data-ldap` starter for collecting the dependencies in a convenient way.



[[data.nosql.ldap.connecting]]
=== Connecting to an LDAP Server

To connect to an LDAP server, make sure you declare a dependency on the `spring-boot-starter-data-ldap` starter or `spring-ldap-core` and then declare the URLs of your server in your application.properties, as shown in the following example:

[configprops,yaml]
----
spring:
  ldap:
    urls: "ldap://myserver:1235"
    username: "admin"
    password: "secret"
----

If you need to customize connection settings, you can use the `spring.ldap.base` and `spring.ldap.base-environment` properties.

An javadoc:org.springframework.ldap.core.support.LdapContextSource[] is auto-configured based on these settings.
If a javadoc:org.springframework.ldap.core.support.DirContextAuthenticationStrategy[] bean is available, it is associated to the auto-configured javadoc:org.springframework.ldap.core.support.LdapContextSource[].
If you need to customize it, for instance to use a javadoc:org.springframework.ldap.pool2.factory.PooledContextSource[], you can still inject the auto-configured javadoc:org.springframework.ldap.core.support.LdapContextSource[].
Make sure to flag your customized javadoc:org.springframework.ldap.core.ContextSource[] as javadoc:org.springframework.context.annotation.Primary[format=annotation] so that the auto-configured javadoc:org.springframework.ldap.core.LdapTemplate[] uses it.



[[data.nosql.ldap.repositories]]
=== Spring Data LDAP Repositories

Spring Data includes repository support for LDAP.

Repositories and documents are found through scanning.
By default, the xref:using/auto-configuration.adoc#using.auto-configuration.packages[auto-configuration packages] are scanned.
You can customize the locations to look for repositories and documents by using javadoc:org.springframework.data.ldap.repository.config.EnableLdapRepositories[format=annotation] and javadoc:org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.domain.EntityScan[format=annotation] respectively.

TIP: For complete details of Spring Data LDAP, see the {url-spring-data-ldap-docs}[reference documentation].

You can also inject an auto-configured javadoc:org.springframework.ldap.core.LdapTemplate[] instance as you would with any other Spring Bean, as shown in the following example:


include-code::MyBean[]



[[data.nosql.ldap.embedded]]
=== Embedded In-memory LDAP Server

For testing purposes, Spring Boot supports auto-configuration of an in-memory LDAP server from https://ldap.com/unboundid-ldap-sdk-for-java/[UnboundID].
To configure the server, add a dependency to `com.unboundid:unboundid-ldapsdk` and declare a configprop:spring.ldap.embedded.base-dn[] property, as follows:

[configprops,yaml]
----
spring:
  ldap:
    embedded:
      base-dn: "dc=spring,dc=io"
----

[NOTE]
====
It is possible to define multiple base-dn values, however, since distinguished names usually contain commas, they must be defined using the correct notation.

In yaml files, you can use the yaml list notation. In properties files, you must include the index as part of the property name:

[configprops,yaml]
----
spring.ldap.embedded.base-dn:
- "dc=spring,dc=io"
- "dc=vmware,dc=com"
----
====

By default, the server starts on a random port and triggers the regular LDAP support.
There is no need to specify a configprop:spring.ldap.urls[] property.

If there is a `schema.ldif` file on your classpath, it is used to initialize the server.
If you want to load the initialization script from a different resource, you can also use the configprop:spring.ldap.embedded.ldif[] property.

By default, a standard schema is used to validate `LDIF` files.
You can turn off validation altogether by setting the configprop:spring.ldap.embedded.validation.enabled[] property.
If you have custom attributes, you can use configprop:spring.ldap.embedded.validation.schema[] to define your custom attribute types or object classes.
