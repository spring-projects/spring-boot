Spring Boot is well suited for web application development.
You can create a self-contained HTTP server by using embedded Tomcat, Jetty, Undertow, or Netty.
Most web applications use the `spring-boot-starter-web` module to get up and running quickly.
You can also choose to build reactive web applications by using the `spring-boot-starter-webflux` module.

If you have not yet developed a Spring Boot web application, you can follow the "`Hello World!`" example in the xref:tutorial:first-application/index.adoc[Getting started] section.
