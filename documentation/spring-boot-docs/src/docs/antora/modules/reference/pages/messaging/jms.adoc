[[messaging.jms]]
= JMS

The javadoc:jakarta.jms.ConnectionFactory[] interface provides a standard method of creating a javadoc:jakarta.jms.Connection[] for interacting with a JMS broker.
Although Spring needs a javadoc:jakarta.jms.ConnectionFactory[] to work with JMS, you generally need not use it directly yourself and can instead rely on higher level messaging abstractions.
(See the {url-spring-framework-docs}/integration/jms.html[relevant section] of the Spring Framework reference documentation for details.)
Spring Boot also auto-configures the necessary infrastructure to send and receive messages.



[[messaging.jms.activemq]]
== ActiveMQ "Classic" Support

When https://activemq.apache.org/components/classic[ActiveMQ "Classic"] is available on the classpath, Spring Boot can configure a javadoc:jakarta.jms.ConnectionFactory[].
If the broker is present, an embedded broker is automatically started and configured (provided no broker URL is specified through configuration and the embedded broker is not disabled in the configuration).

NOTE: If you use `spring-boot-starter-activemq`, the necessary dependencies to connect to an ActiveMQ "Classic" instance are provided, as is the Spring infrastructure to integrate with JMS.
Adding `org.apache.activemq:activemq-broker` to your application lets you use the embedded broker.

ActiveMQ "Classic" configuration is controlled by external configuration properties in `+spring.activemq.*+`.

If `activemq-broker` is on the classpath, ActiveMQ "Classic" is auto-configured to use the https://activemq.apache.org/vm-transport-reference.html[VM transport], which starts a broker embedded in the same JVM instance.

You can disable the embedded broker by configuring the configprop:spring.activemq.embedded.enabled[] property, as shown in the following example:

[configprops,yaml]
----
spring:
  activemq:
    embedded:
      enabled: false
----

The embedded broker will also be disabled if you configure the broker URL, as shown in the following example:

[configprops,yaml]
----
spring:
  activemq:
    broker-url: "tcp://192.168.1.210:9876"
    user: "admin"
    password: "secret"
----

If you want to take full control over the embedded broker, see https://activemq.apache.org/how-do-i-embed-a-broker-inside-a-connection.html[the ActiveMQ "Classic" documentation] for further information.

By default, a javadoc:org.springframework.jms.connection.CachingConnectionFactory[] wraps the native javadoc:jakarta.jms.ConnectionFactory[] with sensible settings that you can control by external configuration properties in `+spring.jms.*+`:

[configprops,yaml]
----
spring:
  jms:
    cache:
      session-cache-size: 5
----

If you'd rather use native pooling, you can do so by adding a dependency to `org.messaginghub:pooled-jms` and configuring the javadoc:org.messaginghub.pooled.jms.JmsPoolConnectionFactory[] accordingly, as shown in the following example:

[configprops,yaml]
----
spring:
  activemq:
    pool:
      enabled: true
      max-connections: 50
----

TIP: See javadoc:org.springframework.boot.activemq.autoconfigure.ActiveMQProperties[] for more of the supported options.
You can also register an arbitrary number of beans that implement javadoc:org.springframework.boot.activemq.autoconfigure.ActiveMQConnectionFactoryCustomizer[] for more advanced customizations.

By default, ActiveMQ "Classic" creates a destination if it does not yet exist so that destinations are resolved against their provided names.



[[messaging.jms.artemis]]
== ActiveMQ Artemis Support

Spring Boot can auto-configure a javadoc:jakarta.jms.ConnectionFactory[] when it detects that https://activemq.apache.org/components/artemis/[ActiveMQ Artemis] is available on the classpath.
If the broker is present, an embedded broker is automatically started and configured (unless the mode property has been explicitly set).
The supported modes are `embedded` (to make explicit that an embedded broker is required and that an error should occur if the broker is not available on the classpath) and `native` (to connect to a broker using the `netty` transport protocol).
When the latter is configured, Spring Boot configures a javadoc:jakarta.jms.ConnectionFactory[] that connects to a broker running on the local machine with the default settings.

NOTE: If you use `spring-boot-starter-artemis`, the necessary dependencies to connect to an existing ActiveMQ Artemis instance are provided, as well as the Spring infrastructure to integrate with JMS.
Adding `org.apache.activemq:artemis-jakarta-server` to your application lets you use embedded mode.

ActiveMQ Artemis configuration is controlled by external configuration properties in `+spring.artemis.*+`.
For example, you might declare the following section in `application.properties`:

[configprops,yaml]
----
spring:
  artemis:
    mode: native
    broker-url: "tcp://192.168.1.210:9876"
    user: "admin"
    password: "secret"
----

When embedding the broker, you can choose if you want to enable persistence and list the destinations that should be made available.
These can be specified as a comma-separated list to create them with the default options, or you can define bean(s) of type javadoc:org.apache.activemq.artemis.jms.server.config.JMSQueueConfiguration[] or javadoc:org.apache.activemq.artemis.jms.server.config.TopicConfiguration[], for advanced queue and topic configurations, respectively.

By default, a javadoc:org.springframework.jms.connection.CachingConnectionFactory[] wraps the native javadoc:jakarta.jms.ConnectionFactory[] with sensible settings that you can control by external configuration properties in `+spring.jms.*+`:

[configprops,yaml]
----
spring:
  jms:
    cache:
      session-cache-size: 5
----

If you'd rather use native pooling, you can do so by adding a dependency on `org.messaginghub:pooled-jms` and configuring the javadoc:org.messaginghub.pooled.jms.JmsPoolConnectionFactory[] accordingly, as shown in the following example:

[configprops,yaml]
----
spring:
  artemis:
    pool:
      enabled: true
      max-connections: 50
----

See javadoc:org.springframework.boot.artemis.autoconfigure.ArtemisProperties[] for more supported options.

No JNDI lookup is involved, and destinations are resolved against their names, using either the `name` attribute in the ActiveMQ Artemis configuration or the names provided through configuration.



[[messaging.jms.jndi]]
== Using a JNDI ConnectionFactory

If you are running your application in an application server, Spring Boot tries to locate a JMS javadoc:jakarta.jms.ConnectionFactory[] by using JNDI.
By default, the `java:/JmsXA` and `java:/XAConnectionFactory` location are checked.
You can use the configprop:spring.jms.jndi-name[] property if you need to specify an alternative location, as shown in the following example:

[configprops,yaml]
----
spring:
  jms:
    jndi-name: "java:/MyConnectionFactory"
----



[[messaging.jms.sending]]
== Sending a Message

Spring's javadoc:org.springframework.jms.core.JmsClient[] is auto-configured, and you can autowire it directly into your own beans, as shown in the following example:

include-code::MyBean[]

NOTE: javadoc:org.springframework.jms.core.JmsMessagingTemplate[] can be injected in a similar manner, and both use the traditional javadoc:org.springframework.jms.core.JmsTemplate[] that can be injected as well.
If a javadoc:org.springframework.jms.support.destination.DestinationResolver[] or a javadoc:org.springframework.jms.support.converter.MessageConverter[] bean is defined, it is associated automatically to the auto-configured javadoc:org.springframework.jms.core.JmsTemplate[].



[[messaging.jms.receiving]]
== Receiving a Message

When the JMS infrastructure is present, any bean can be annotated with javadoc:org.springframework.jms.annotation.JmsListener[format=annotation] to create a listener endpoint.
If no javadoc:org.springframework.jms.config.JmsListenerContainerFactory[] has been defined, a default one is configured automatically.
If a javadoc:org.springframework.jms.support.destination.DestinationResolver[], a javadoc:org.springframework.jms.support.converter.MessageConverter[], or a javadoc:jakarta.jms.ExceptionListener[] beans are defined, they are associated automatically with the default factory.

In most scenarios, message listener containers should be configured against the native javadoc:jakarta.jms.ConnectionFactory[].
This way each listener container has its own connection and this gives full responsibility to it in terms of local recovery.
The auto-configuration uses javadoc:org.springframework.boot.jms.ConnectionFactoryUnwrapper[] to unwrap the native connection factory from the auto-configured one.

NOTE: The auto-configuration only unwraps `CachedConnectionFactory`.

By default, the default factory is transactional.
If you run in an infrastructure where a javadoc:org.springframework.transaction.jta.JtaTransactionManager[] is present, it is associated to the listener container by default.
If not, the `sessionTransacted` flag is enabled.
In that latter scenario, you can associate your local data store transaction to the processing of an incoming message by adding javadoc:org.springframework.transaction.annotation.Transactional[format=annotation] on your listener method (or a delegate thereof).
This ensures that the incoming message is acknowledged, once the local transaction has completed.
This also includes sending response messages that have been performed on the same JMS session.

The following component creates a listener endpoint on the `someQueue` destination:

include-code::MyBean[]

TIP: See the javadoc:org.springframework.jms.annotation.EnableJms[format=annotation] API documentation for more details.

If you need to create more javadoc:org.springframework.jms.config.JmsListenerContainerFactory[] instances or if you want to override the default, Spring Boot provides a javadoc:org.springframework.boot.jms.autoconfigure.DefaultJmsListenerContainerFactoryConfigurer[] that you can use to initialize a javadoc:org.springframework.jms.config.DefaultJmsListenerContainerFactory[] with the same settings as the one that is auto-configured.

For instance, the following example exposes another factory that uses a specific javadoc:org.springframework.jms.support.converter.MessageConverter[]:

include-code::custom/MyJmsConfiguration[]

NOTE: In the example above, the customization uses javadoc:org.springframework.boot.jms.ConnectionFactoryUnwrapper[] to associate the native connection factory to the message listener container the same way the auto-configured factory does.

Then you can use the factory in any javadoc:org.springframework.jms.annotation.JmsListener[format=annotation]-annotated method as follows:

include-code::custom/MyBean[]
