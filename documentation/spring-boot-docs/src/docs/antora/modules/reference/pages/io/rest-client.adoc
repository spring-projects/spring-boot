= Calling REST Services

Spring Boot provides various convenient ways to call remote REST services.
If you are developing a non-blocking reactive application and you're using Spring WebFlux, then you can use javadoc:org.springframework.web.reactive.function.client.WebClient[].
If you prefer blocking APIs then you can use javadoc:org.springframework.web.client.RestClient[] or javadoc:org.springframework.web.client.RestTemplate[].



[[io.rest-client.webclient]]
== WebClient

If you have Spring WebFlux on your classpath we recommend that you use javadoc:org.springframework.web.reactive.function.client.WebClient[] to call remote REST services.
The javadoc:org.springframework.web.reactive.function.client.WebClient[] interface provides a functional style API and is fully reactive.
You can learn more about the javadoc:org.springframework.web.reactive.function.client.WebClient[] in the dedicated {url-spring-framework-docs}/web/webflux-webclient.html[section in the Spring Framework docs].

TIP: If you are not writing a reactive Spring WebFlux application you can use the xref:io/rest-client.adoc#io.rest-client.restclient[`RestClient`] instead of a javadoc:org.springframework.web.reactive.function.client.WebClient[].
This provides a similar functional API, but is blocking rather than reactive.

Spring Boot creates and pre-configures a prototype javadoc:org.springframework.web.reactive.function.client.WebClient$Builder[] bean for you.
It is strongly advised to inject it in your components and use it to create javadoc:org.springframework.web.reactive.function.client.WebClient[] instances.
Spring Boot is configuring that builder to share HTTP resources and reflect codecs setup in the same fashion as the server ones (see xref:web/reactive.adoc#web.reactive.webflux.httpcodecs[WebFlux HTTP codecs auto-configuration]), and more.

The following code shows a typical example:

include-code::MyService[]



[[io.rest-client.webclient.runtime]]
=== WebClient Runtime

Spring Boot will auto-detect which javadoc:org.springframework.http.client.reactive.ClientHttpConnector[] to use to drive javadoc:org.springframework.web.reactive.function.client.WebClient[] depending on the libraries available on the application classpath.
In order of preference, the following clients are supported:

. Reactor Netty
. Jetty RS client
. Apache HttpClient
. JDK HttpClient

If multiple clients are available on the classpath, the most preferred client will be used.

The `spring-boot-starter-webflux` starter depends on `io.projectreactor.netty:reactor-netty` by default, which brings both server and client implementations.
If you choose to use Jetty as a reactive server instead, you should add a dependency on the Jetty Reactive HTTP client library, `org.eclipse.jetty:jetty-reactive-httpclient`.
Using the same technology for server and client has its advantages, as it will automatically share HTTP resources between client and server.

Developers can override the resource configuration for Jetty and Reactor Netty by providing a custom javadoc:org.springframework.http.client.ReactorResourceFactory[] or javadoc:org.springframework.http.client.reactive.JettyResourceFactory[] bean - this will be applied to both clients and servers.

If you wish to override that choice for the client, you can define your own javadoc:org.springframework.http.client.reactive.ClientHttpConnector[] bean and have full control over the client configuration.

You can learn more about the {url-spring-framework-docs}/web/webflux-webclient/client-builder.html[`WebClient` configuration options in the Spring Framework reference documentation].



[[io.rest-client.webclient.configuration]]
=== Global HTTP Connector Configuration

If the auto-detected javadoc:org.springframework.http.client.reactive.ClientHttpConnector[] does not meet your needs, you can use the configprop:spring.http.reactiveclient.connector[] property to pick a specific connector.
For example, if you have Reactor Netty on your classpath, but you prefer Jetty's javadoc:org.eclipse.jetty.client.HttpClient[] you can add the following:

[configprops,yaml]
----
spring:
  http:
    reactiveclient:
      connector: jetty
----

You can also set properties to change defaults that will be applied to all reactive connectors.
For example, you may want to change timeouts and if redirects are followed:

[configprops,yaml]
----
spring:
  http:
    reactiveclient:
      connect-timeout: 2s
      read-timeout: 1s
      redirects: dont-follow
----

For more complex customizations, you can use javadoc:org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.http.client.reactive.ClientHttpConnectorBuilderCustomizer[] or declare your own javadoc:org.springframework.boot.http.client.reactive.ClientHttpConnectorBuilder[] bean which will cause auto-configuration to back off.
This can be useful when you need to customize some of the internals of the underlying HTTP library.

For example, the following will use a JDK client configured with a specific javadoc:java.net.ProxySelector[]:

include-code::MyConnectorHttpConfiguration[]




[[io.rest-client.webclient.customization]]
=== WebClient Customization

There are three main approaches to javadoc:org.springframework.web.reactive.function.client.WebClient[] customization, depending on how broadly you want the customizations to apply.

To make the scope of any customizations as narrow as possible, inject the auto-configured javadoc:org.springframework.web.reactive.function.client.WebClient$Builder[] and then call its methods as required.
javadoc:org.springframework.web.reactive.function.client.WebClient$Builder[] instances are stateful: Any change on the builder is reflected in all clients subsequently created with it.
If you want to create several clients with the same builder, you can also consider cloning the builder with `WebClient.Builder other = builder.clone();`.

To make an application-wide, additive customization to all javadoc:org.springframework.web.reactive.function.client.WebClient$Builder[] instances, you can declare javadoc:org.springframework.boot.web.reactive.function.client.WebClientCustomizer[] beans and change the javadoc:org.springframework.web.reactive.function.client.WebClient$Builder[] locally at the point of injection.

Finally, you can fall back to the original API and use `WebClient.create()`.
In that case, no auto-configuration or javadoc:org.springframework.boot.web.reactive.function.client.WebClientCustomizer[] is applied.



[[io.rest-client.webclient.ssl]]
=== WebClient SSL Support

If you need custom SSL configuration on the javadoc:org.springframework.http.client.reactive.ClientHttpConnector[] used by the javadoc:org.springframework.web.reactive.function.client.WebClient[], you can inject a javadoc:org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.web.reactive.function.client.WebClientSsl[] instance that can be used with the builder's `apply` method.

The javadoc:org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.web.reactive.function.client.WebClientSsl[] interface provides access to any xref:features/ssl.adoc#features.ssl.bundles[SSL bundles] that you have defined in your `application.properties` or `application.yaml` file.

The following code shows a typical example:

include-code::MyService[]



[[io.rest-client.restclient]]
== RestClient

If you are not using Spring WebFlux or Project Reactor in your application we recommend that you use javadoc:org.springframework.web.client.RestClient[] to call remote REST services.

The javadoc:org.springframework.web.client.RestClient[] interface provides a functional style blocking API.

Spring Boot creates and pre-configures a prototype javadoc:org.springframework.web.client.RestClient$Builder[] bean for you.
It is strongly advised to inject it in your components and use it to create javadoc:org.springframework.web.client.RestClient[] instances.
Spring Boot is configuring that builder with javadoc:org.springframework.boot.http.converter.autoconfigure.HttpMessageConverters[] and an appropriate javadoc:org.springframework.http.client.ClientHttpRequestFactory[].

The following code shows a typical example:

include-code::MyService[]



[[io.rest-client.restclient.customization]]
=== RestClient Customization

There are three main approaches to javadoc:org.springframework.web.client.RestClient[] customization, depending on how broadly you want the customizations to apply.

To make the scope of any customizations as narrow as possible, inject the auto-configured javadoc:org.springframework.web.client.RestClient$Builder[] and then call its methods as required.
javadoc:org.springframework.web.client.RestClient$Builder[] instances are stateful: Any change on the builder is reflected in all clients subsequently created with it.
If you want to create several clients with the same builder, you can also consider cloning the builder with `RestClient.Builder other = builder.clone();`.

To make an application-wide, additive customization to all javadoc:org.springframework.web.client.RestClient$Builder[] instances, you can declare javadoc:org.springframework.boot.web.client.RestClientCustomizer[] beans and change the javadoc:org.springframework.web.client.RestClient$Builder[] locally at the point of injection.

Finally, you can fall back to the original API and use `RestClient.create()`.
In that case, no auto-configuration or javadoc:org.springframework.boot.web.client.RestClientCustomizer[] is applied.

TIP: You can also change the xref:io/rest-client.adoc#io.rest-client.clienthttprequestfactory.configuration[global HTTP client configuration].



[[io.rest-client.restclient.ssl]]
=== RestClient SSL Support

If you need custom SSL configuration on the javadoc:org.springframework.http.client.ClientHttpRequestFactory[] used by the javadoc:org.springframework.web.client.RestClient[], you can inject a javadoc:org.springframework.boot.restclient.autoconfigure.RestClientSsl[] instance that can be used with the builder's `apply` method.

The javadoc:org.springframework.boot.restclient.autoconfigure.RestClientSsl[] interface provides access to any xref:features/ssl.adoc#features.ssl.bundles[SSL bundles] that you have defined in your `application.properties` or `application.yaml` file.

The following code shows a typical example:

include-code::MyService[]

If you need to apply other customization in addition to an SSL bundle, you can use the javadoc:org.springframework.boot.http.client.ClientHttpRequestFactorySettings[] class with javadoc:org.springframework.boot.http.client.ClientHttpRequestFactoryBuilder[]:

include-code::settings/MyService[]



[[io.rest-client.resttemplate]]
== RestTemplate

Spring Framework's javadoc:org.springframework.web.client.RestTemplate[] class predates javadoc:org.springframework.web.client.RestClient[] and is the classic way that many applications use to call remote REST services.
You might choose to use javadoc:org.springframework.web.client.RestTemplate[] when you have existing code that you don't want to migrate to javadoc:org.springframework.web.client.RestClient[], or because you're already familiar with the javadoc:org.springframework.web.client.RestTemplate[] API.

Since javadoc:org.springframework.web.client.RestTemplate[] instances often need to be customized before being used, Spring Boot does not provide any single auto-configured javadoc:org.springframework.web.client.RestTemplate[] bean.
It does, however, auto-configure a javadoc:org.springframework.boot.web.client.RestTemplateBuilder[], which can be used to create javadoc:org.springframework.web.client.RestTemplate[] instances when needed.
The auto-configured javadoc:org.springframework.boot.web.client.RestTemplateBuilder[] ensures that sensible javadoc:org.springframework.boot.http.converter.autoconfigure.HttpMessageConverters[] and an appropriate javadoc:org.springframework.http.client.ClientHttpRequestFactory[] are applied to javadoc:org.springframework.web.client.RestTemplate[] instances.

The following code shows a typical example:

include-code::MyService[]

javadoc:org.springframework.boot.web.client.RestTemplateBuilder[] includes a number of useful methods that can be used to quickly configure a javadoc:org.springframework.web.client.RestTemplate[].
For example, to add BASIC authentication support, you can use `builder.basicAuthentication("user", "password").build()`.



[[io.rest-client.resttemplate.customization]]
=== RestTemplate Customization

There are three main approaches to javadoc:org.springframework.web.client.RestTemplate[] customization, depending on how broadly you want the customizations to apply.

To make the scope of any customizations as narrow as possible, inject the auto-configured javadoc:org.springframework.boot.web.client.RestTemplateBuilder[] and then call its methods as required.
Each method call returns a new javadoc:org.springframework.boot.web.client.RestTemplateBuilder[] instance, so the customizations only affect this use of the builder.

To make an application-wide, additive customization, use a javadoc:org.springframework.boot.web.client.RestTemplateCustomizer[] bean.
All such beans are automatically registered with the auto-configured javadoc:org.springframework.boot.web.client.RestTemplateBuilder[] and are applied to any templates that are built with it.

The following example shows a customizer that configures the use of a proxy for all hosts except `192.168.0.5`:

include-code::MyRestTemplateCustomizer[]

Finally, you can define your own javadoc:org.springframework.boot.web.client.RestTemplateBuilder[] bean.
Doing so will replace the auto-configured builder.
If you want any javadoc:org.springframework.boot.web.client.RestTemplateCustomizer[] beans to be applied to your custom builder, as the auto-configuration would have done, configure it using a javadoc:org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.web.client.RestTemplateBuilderConfigurer[].
The following example exposes a javadoc:org.springframework.boot.web.client.RestTemplateBuilder[] that matches what Spring Boot's auto-configuration would have done, except that custom connect and read timeouts are also specified:

include-code::MyRestTemplateBuilderConfiguration[]

The most extreme (and rarely used) option is to create your own javadoc:org.springframework.boot.web.client.RestTemplateBuilder[] bean without using a configurer.
In addition to replacing the auto-configured builder, this also prevents any javadoc:org.springframework.boot.web.client.RestTemplateCustomizer[] beans from being used.

TIP: You can also change the xref:io/rest-client.adoc#io.rest-client.clienthttprequestfactory.configuration[global HTTP client configuration].



[[io.rest-client.resttemplate.ssl]]
=== RestTemplate SSL Support

If you need custom SSL configuration on the javadoc:org.springframework.web.client.RestTemplate[], you can apply an xref:features/ssl.adoc#features.ssl.bundles[SSL bundle] to the javadoc:org.springframework.boot.web.client.RestTemplateBuilder[] as shown in this example:

include-code::MyService[]



[[io.rest-client.clienthttprequestfactory]]
== HTTP Client Detection for RestClient and RestTemplate

Spring Boot will auto-detect which HTTP client to use with javadoc:org.springframework.web.client.RestClient[] and javadoc:org.springframework.web.client.RestTemplate[] depending on the libraries available on the application classpath.
In order of preference, the following clients are supported:

. Apache HttpClient
. Jetty HttpClient
. Reactor Netty HttpClient
. JDK client (`java.net.http.HttpClient`)
. Simple JDK client (`java.net.HttpURLConnection`)

If multiple clients are available on the classpath, and not global configuration is provided, the most preferred client will be used.



[[io.rest-client.clienthttprequestfactory.configuration]]
=== Global HTTP Client Configuration

If the auto-detected HTTP client does not meet your needs, you can use the configprop:spring.http.client.factory[] property to pick a specific factory.
For example, if you have Apache HttpClient on your classpath, but you prefer Jetty's javadoc:org.eclipse.jetty.client.HttpClient[] you can add the following:

[configprops,yaml]
----
spring:
  http:
    client:
      factory: jetty
----

You can also set properties to change defaults that will be applied to all clients.
For example, you may want to change timeouts and if redirects are followed:

[configprops,yaml]
----
spring:
  http:
    client:
      connect-timeout: 2s
      read-timeout: 1s
      redirects: dont-follow
----

For more complex customizations, you can use javadoc:org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.http.client.ClientHttpRequestFactoryBuilderCustomizer[] or declare your own javadoc:org.springframework.boot.http.client.ClientHttpRequestFactoryBuilder[] bean which will cause auto-configuration to back off.
This can be useful when you need to customize some of the internals of the underlying HTTP library.

For example, the following will use a JDK client configured with a specific javadoc:java.net.ProxySelector[]:

include-code::MyClientHttpConfiguration[]



[[io.rest-client.apiversioning]]
== API Versioning

Both `WebClient` and `RestClient` support making versioned remote HTTP calls so that APIs can be evolved over time.
Commonly this involves sending an HTTP header, a query parameter or URL path segment that indicates the version of the API that should be used.

You can configure API versioning using methods on `WebClient.Builder` or `RestClient.Builder`.
You can also the `spring.http.reactiveclient.webclient.apiversion` or `spring.http.client.restclient.apiversion` properties if you want to apply the same configuration to all builders.

For example, the following adds an `X-Version` HTTP header to all calls from the `RestClient` and uses the version `1.0.0` unless overridden for specific requests:

[configprops,yaml]
----
spring:
  http:
    client:
      restclient:
        apiversion:
          default: 1.0.0
          insert:
            header: X-Version
----

You can also define javadoc:org.springframework.web.client.ApiVersionInserter[] and javadoc:org.springframework.web.client.ApiVersionFormatter[] beans if you need more control of the way that version information should be inserted and formatted.

TIP: API versioning is also supported on the server-side.
See the xref:web/servlet.adoc#web.servlet.spring-mvc.api-versioning[Spring MVC] and xref:web/reactive.adoc#web.reactive.webflux.api-versioning[Spring WebFlux] sections for details.
