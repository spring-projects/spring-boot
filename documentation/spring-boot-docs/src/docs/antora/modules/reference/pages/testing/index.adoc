= Testing

Spring Boot provides a number of utilities and annotations to help when testing your application.

Test support is provided by two general-purpose modules – `spring-boot-test` contains core items and `spring-boot-test-autoconfigure` supports auto-configuration for tests – and several focused `-test` modules that provide testing support for a particular feature.

Most developers use the `spring-boot-starter-test` starter, which imports both general-purpose Spring Boot test modules as well as JUnit Jupiter, AssertJ, Hamcrest, and a number of other useful libraries, and the focused `-test` modules that are applicable to their particular application.


`hamcrest-core` is excluded in favor of `org.hamcrest:hamcrest` that is part of `spring-boot-starter-test`.
