= Testing

Spring Boot provides a number of utilities and annotations to help when testing your application.

Test support is provided by two general-purpose modules – `spring-boot-test` contains core items and `spring-boot-test-autoconfigure` supports auto-configuration for tests – and several focused `-test` modules that provide testing support for a particular feature.

Most developers use the `spring-boot-starter-test` starter, which imports both general-purpose Spring Boot test modules as well as JUnit Jupiter, AssertJ, Hamcrest, and a number of other useful libraries, and the focused `-test` modules that are applicable to their particular application.

[TIP]
====
If you have tests that use JUnit 4, JUnit 5's vintage engine can be used to run them.
To use the vintage engine, add a dependency on `junit-vintage-engine`, as shown in the following example:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.junit.vintage</groupId>
	<artifactId>junit-vintage-engine</artifactId>
	<scope>test</scope>
	<exclusions>
		<exclusion>
			<groupId>org.hamcrest</groupId>
			<artifactId>hamcrest-core</artifactId>
		</exclusion>
	</exclusions>
</dependency>
----
====

`hamcrest-core` is excluded in favor of `org.hamcrest:hamcrest` that is part of `spring-boot-starter-test`.
