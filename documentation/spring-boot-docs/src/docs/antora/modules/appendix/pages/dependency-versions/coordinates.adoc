[[appendix.dependency-versions.coordinates]]
= Managed Dependency Coordinates

The following table provides details of all of the dependency versions that are provided by Spring Boot in its CLI (Command Line Interface), Maven dependency management, and Gradle plugin.
When you declare a dependency on one of these artifacts without declaring a version, the version listed in the table is used.
The `Version Property` column shows the property or properties that can be used to override each managed version.
If a dependency does not have a dedicated version property, the column is empty.
See xref:appendix:dependency-versions/properties.adoc[Version Properties] for the list of available version properties.
