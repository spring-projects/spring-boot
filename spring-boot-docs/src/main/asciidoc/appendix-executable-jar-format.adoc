[[executable-jar]]
== The executable jar format
The `spring-boot-loader` modules allows Spring Boot to support executable jar and
war files. If you're using the Maven or Gradle plugin, executable jars are
automatically generated and you generally won't need to know the details of how
they work.

If you need to create executable jars from a different build system, or if you are just
curious about the underlying technology, this section provides some background.



[[executable-jar-nested-jars]]
=== Nested JARs
Java does not provide any standard way to load nested jar files (i.e. jar files that
are themselves contained within a jar). This can be problematic if you are looking
to distribute a self-contained application that you can just run from the command line
without unpacking.

To solve this problem, many developers use "`shaded`" jars. A shaded jar simply packages
all classes, from all jars, into a single 'uber jar'. The problem with shaded jars is
that it becomes hard to see which libraries you are actually using in your application.
It can also be problematic if the the same filename is used (but with different content)
in multiple jars. Spring Boot takes a different approach and allows you to actually nest
jars directly.



[[executable-jar-jar-file-structure]]
==== The executable jar file structure
Spring Boot Loader compatible jar files should be structured in the following way:

[indent=0]
----
	example.jar
	 |
	 +-META-INF
	 |  +-MANIFEST.MF
	 +-org
	 |  +-springframework
	 |     +-boot
	 |        +-loader
	 |           +-<spring boot loader classes>
	 +-com
	 |  +-mycompany
	 |     + project
	 |        +-YouClasses.class
	 +-lib
	    +-dependency1.jar
	    +-dependency2.jar
----

Dependencies should be placed in a nested `lib` directory.



[[executable-jar-war-file-structure]]
==== The executable war file structure
Spring Boot Loader compatible war files should be structured in the following way:

[indent=0]
----
	example.jar
	 |
	 +-META-INF
	 |  +-MANIFEST.MF
	 +-org
	 |  +-springframework
	 |     +-boot
	 |        +-loader
	 |           +-<spring boot loader classes>
	 +-WEB-INF
	    +-classes
	    |  +-com
	    |     +-mycompany
	    |        +-project
	    |           +-YouClasses.class
	    +-lib
	    |  +-dependency1.jar
	    |  +-dependency2.jar
	    +-lib-provided
	       +-servlet-api.jar
	       +-dependency3.jar
----

Dependencies should be placed in a nested `WEB-INF/lib` directory. Any dependencies
that are required when running embedded but are not required when deploying to
a traditional web container should be placed in `WEB-INF/lib-provided`.



[[executable-jar-jarfile]]
=== Spring Boot's "`JarFile`" class
The core class used to support loading nested jars is
`org.springframework.boot.loader.jar.JarFile`. It allows  you load jar
content from a standard jar file, or from nested child jar data. When first  loaded, the
location of each  `JarEntry` is mapped to a physical file offset of the outer jar:

[indent=0]
----
	myapp.jar
	+---------+---------------------+
	|         | /lib/mylib.jar      |
	| A.class |+---------+---------+|
	|         || B.class | B.class ||
	|         |+---------+---------+|
	+---------+---------------------+
	^          ^          ^
	0063       3452       3980
----

The example above shows how `A.class` can be found in `myapp.jar` position `0063`.
`B.class` from the nested jar can actually be found in `myapp.jar` position `3452`
and `B.class` is at position `3980`.

Armed with this information, we can load specific nested entries by simply seeking to
appropriate part if the outer jar. We don't need to unpack the archive and we don't
need to read all entry data into memory.



[[executable-jar-jarfile-compatibility]]
==== Compatibility with the standard Java "`JarFile`"
Spring Boot Loader strives to remain compatible with existing code and libraries.
`org.springframework.boot.loader.jar.JarFile` extends from `java.util.jar.JarFile` and
should work as a drop-in replacement. The `RandomAccessJarFile.getURL()` method will
return a `URL` that opens a `java.net.JarURLConnection` compatible connection.
`RandomAccessJarFile` URLs can be used with Java's `URLClassLoader`.



[[executable-jar-launching]]
=== Launching executable jars
The `org.springframework.boot.loader.Launcher` class is a special bootstrap class that
is used as an executable jars main entry point. It is the actual `Main-Class` in your jar
file and it's used to setup an appropriate `URLClassLoader` and ultimately call your
`main()` method.

There are 3 launcher subclasses (`JarLauncher`, `WarLauncher` and `PropertiesLauncher`).
Their purpose is to load resources (`.class` files etc.) from nested jar files or war
files in directories (as opposed to explicitly on the classpath). In the case of the
`[Jar|War]Launcher` the nested paths are fixed (`+lib/*.jar+` and `+lib-provided/*.jar+` for
the war case) so you just add extra jars in those locations if you want more. The
`PropertiesLauncher` looks in `lib/` by default, but you can add additional locations by
setting an environment variable `LOADER_PATH` or `loader.path` in `application.properties`
(comma-separated list of directories or archives).



[[executable-jar-launcher-manifest]]
==== Launcher manifest
You need to specify an appropriate `Launcher` as the `Main-Class` attribute of
`META-INF/MANIFEST.MF`. The actual class that you want to launch (i.e. the class that
you wrote that contains a `main` method) should be specified  in the `Start-Class`
attribute.

For example, here is a typical `MANIFEST.MF` for an executable jar file:

[indent=0]
----
	Main-Class: org.springframework.boot.loader.JarLauncher
	Start-Class: com.mycompany.project.MyApplication
----

For a war file, it would be:

[indent=0]
----
	Main-Class: org.springframework.boot.loader.WarLauncher
	Start-Class: com.mycompany.project.MyApplication
----

NOTE: You do not need to specify `Class-Path` entries in your manifest file, the classpath
will be deduced from the nested jars.



[[executable-jar-exploded-archives]]
==== Exploded archives
Certain PaaS implementations may choose to unpack archives before they run. For example,
Cloud Foundry operates in this way. You can run an unpacked archive by simply starting
the appropriate launcher:

[indent=0]
----
	$ unzip -q myapp.jar
	$ java org.springframework.boot.loader.JarLauncher
----



[[executable-jar-property-launcher-features]]
=== PropertiesLauncher Features

`PropertiesLauncher` has a few special features that can be enabled with external
properties (System properties, environment variables, manifest entries or
`application.properties`).

[cols="2,4"]
|===
|Key |Purpose

|`loader.path`
|Comma-separated Classpath, e.g. `lib:${HOME}/app/lib`.

|`loader.home`
|Location of additional properties file, e.g. `file:///opt/app`
 (defaults to `${user.dir}`)

|`loader.args`
|Default arguments for the main method (space separated)

|`loader.main`
|Name of main class to launch, e.g. `com.app.Application`.

|`loader.config.name`
|Name of properties file, e.g. `loader` (defaults to `application`).

|`loader.config.location`
|Path to properties file, e.g. `classpath:loader.properties` (defaults to
 `application.properties`).

|`loader.system`
|Boolean flag to indicate that all properties should be added to System properties
 (defaults to `false`)
|===

Manifest entry keys are formed by capitalizing initial letters of words and changing the
separator to "`-`" from "`.`" (e.g. `Loader-Path`). The exception is `loader.main` which
is looked up as `Start-Class` in the manifest for compatibility with `JarLauncher`).

Environment variables can be capitalized with underscore separators instead of periods.

* `loader.home` is the directory location of an additional properties file (overriding
  the default) as long as `loader.config.location` is   not specified.
* `loader.path` can contain directories (scanned recursively for jar and zip files),
  archive paths, or wildcard patterns (for the default JVM behavior).
* Placeholder replacement is done from System and environment variables plus the
  properties file itself on all values before use.



[[executable-jar-restrictions]]
=== Executable jar restrictions
There are a number of restrictions that you need to consider when working with a Spring
Boot Loader packaged application.



[[executable-jar-zip-entry-compression]]
==== Zip entry compression
The `ZipEntry` for a nested jar must be saved using the `ZipEntry.STORED` method. This
is required so that we can seek directly to individual content within the nested jar.
The content of the nested jar file itself can still be compressed, as can any other
entries in the outer jar.



[[executable-jar-system-classloader]]
==== System ClassLoader
Launched applications should use `Thread.getContextClassLoader()` when loading classes
(most libraries and frameworks will do this by default). Trying to load nested jar
classes via `ClassLoader.getSystemClassLoader()` will fail. Please be aware that
`java.util.Logging` always uses the system classloader, for this reason you should
consider a different logging implementation.



[[executable-jar-alternatives]]
=== Alternative single jar solutions
If the above restrictions mean that you cannot use Spring Boot Loader the following
alternatives could be considered:
