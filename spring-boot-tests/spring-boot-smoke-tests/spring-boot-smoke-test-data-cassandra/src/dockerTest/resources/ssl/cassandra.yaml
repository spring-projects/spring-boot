# This defines the number of tokens randomly assigned to this node on the ring
# The more tokens, relative to other nodes, the larger the proportion of data
# that this node will store. You probably want all nodes to have the same number
# of tokens assuming they have equal hardware capability.
#
# If you leave this unspecified, Cassandra will use the default of 1 token for legacy compatibility,
# and will use the initial_token as described below.
#
# Specifying initial_token will override this setting on the node's initial start,
# on subsequent starts, this setting will apply even if initial token is set.
#
# If you already have a cluster with 1 token per node, and wish to migrate to 
# multiple tokens per node, see https://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/Operations
num_tokens: 256

# Triggers automatic allocation of num_tokens tokens for this node. The allocation
# algorithm attempts to choose tokens in a way that optimizes replicated load over

# vnodes.

# initial_token allows you to specify tokens manually.  While you can use it with

# This sets the number of memtable flush writer threads per disk

# These are generally a combination of compute and IO bound.
#
# Memtable flushing is more CPU efficient than memtable ingest and a single thread
# can keep up with the ingest rate of a whole server on a single fast disk
# until it temporarily becomes IO bound under contention typically with compaction.
# At that point you need multiple flush threads. At some point in the future
# it may become CPU bound all the time.
#
# You can tell if flushing is falling behind using the MemtablePool.BlockedOnAllocation

# to free memory.
#
# memtable_flush_writers defaults to two for a single data directory.
# This means that two  memtables can be flushed concurrently to the single data directory.
# If you have multiple data directories the default is one memtable flushing at a time
# but the flush will use a thread per data directory so you will get two or more writers.
#
# Two is generally enough to flush on a fast disk [array] mounted as a single data directory.
# Adding more flush writers will result in smaller more frequent flushes that introduce more
# compaction overhead.
#
# There is a direct tradeoff between number of memtables that can be flushed concurrently

# Cassandra provides two out-of-the-box options for the RPC Server:
#
# sync
#   One thread per thrift connection. For a very large number of clients, memory
#   will be your limiting factor. On a 64 bit JVM, 180KB is the minimum stack size
#   per thread, and that will correspond to your use of virtual memory (but physical memory
#   may be limited depending on use of stack space).
#
# hsha
#   Stands for "half synchronous, half asynchronous." All thrift clients are handled
#   asynchronously using a small number of threads that does not vary with the amount
#   of thrift clients (and thus scales well to many clients). The rpc requests are still
#   synchronous (one thread per active request). If hsha is selected then it is essential
#   that rpc_max_threads is changed from the default value of unlimited.
#
# The default is sync because on Windows hsha is about 30% slower.  On Linux,
# sync/hsha performance is about the same, with hsha of course using less memory.
#
# Alternatively,  can provide your own RPC server by providing the fully-qualified class name

# endpoint_snitch -- Set this to a class that implements
# IEndpointSnitch.  The snitch has two functions:
#
# - it teaches Cassandra enough about your network topology to route
#   requests efficiently
# - it allows Cassandra to spread replicas around your cluster to avoid
#   correlated failures. It does this by grouping machines into
#   "datacenters" and "racks."  Cassandra will do its best not to have
#   more than one replica on the same "rack" (which may not actually
#   be a physical location)
#
# CASSANDRA WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO SWITCH TO AN INCOMPATIBLE SNITCH
# ONCE DATA IS INSERTED INTO THE CLUSTER.  This would cause data loss.
# This means that if you start with the default SimpleSnitch, which
# locates every node on "rack1" in "datacenter1", your only options
# if you need to add another datacenter are GossipingPropertyFileSnitch
# (and the older PFS).  From there, if you want to migrate to an
# incompatible snitch like Ec2Snitch you can do it by adding new nodes
# under Ec2Snitch (which will locate them in a new "datacenter") and
# decommissioning the old ones.
#
# Out of the box, Cassandra provides:
#
# SimpleSnitch:
#    Treats Strategy order as proximity. This can improve cache
#    locality when disabling read repair.  Only appropriate for
#    single-datacenter deployments.
#
# GossipingPropertyFileSnitch
#    This should be your go-to snitch for production use.  The rack
#    and datacenter for the local node are defined in
#    cassandra-rackdc.properties and propagated to other nodes via
#    gossip.  If cassandra-topology.properties exists, it is used as a
#    fallback, allowing migration from the PropertyFileSnitch.
#
# PropertyFileSnitch:
#    Proximity is determined by rack and data center, which are
#    explicitly configured in cassandra-topology.properties.
#
# Ec2Snitch:
#    Appropriate for EC2 deployments in a single Region. Loads Region
#    and Availability Zone information from the EC2 API. The Region is
#    treated as the datacenter, and the Availability Zone as the rack.
#    Only private IPs are used, so this will not work across multiple
#    Regions.
#
# Ec2MultiRegionSnitch:
#    Uses public IPs as broadcast_address to allow cross-region
#    connectivity.  (Thus, you should set seed addresses to the public
#    IP as well.) You will need to open the storage_port or
#    ssl_storage_port on the public IP firewall.  (For intra-Region
#    traffic, Cassandra will switch to the private IP after
#    establishing a connection.)
#
# RackInferringSnitch:
#    Proximity is determined by rack and data center, which are
#    assumed to correspond to the 3rd and 2nd octet of each node's IP
#    address, respectively.  Unless this happens to match your
#    deployment conventions, this is best used as an example of
#    writing a custom Snitch class and is provided in that spirit.
#
# You can use a custom Snitch by setting this to the full class name
# of the snitch, which will be assumed to be on your classpath.

# On bare metal, the floor for packet processing throughput is high enough that many applications won't notice, but in
# virtualized environments, the point at which an application can be bound by network packet processing can be
# surprisingly low compared to the throughput of task processing that is possible inside a VM. It's not that bare metal
# doesn't benefit from coalescing messages, it's that the number of packets a bare metal network interface can process
# is sufficient for many applications such that no load starvation is experienced even without coalescing.
# There are other benefits to coalescing network messages that are harder to isolate with a simple metric like messages
# per second. By coalescing multiple tasks together, a network thread can process multiple messages for the cost of one
# trip to read from a socket, and all the task submission work can be done at the same time reducing context switching
# and increasing cache friendliness of network message processing.
# See CASSANDRA-8692 for details.

# Strategy to use for coalescing messages in OutboundTcpConnection.
# Can be fixed, movingaverage, timehorizon, disabled (default).
# You can also specify a subclass of CoalescingStrategies.CoalescingStrategy by name.
# otc_coalescing_strategy: DISABLED

# How many microseconds to wait for coalescing. For fixed strategy this is the amount of time after the first
# message is received before it will be sent with any accompanying messages. For moving average this is the
# maximum amount of time that will be waited as well as the interval at which messages must arrive on average
# for coalescing to be enabled.
# otc_coalescing_window_us: 200

# Do not try to coalesce messages if we already got that many messages. This should be more than 2 and less than 128.
# otc_coalescing_enough_coalesced_messages: 8

# How many milliseconds to wait between two expiration runs on the backlog (queue) of the OutboundTcpConnection.
# Expiration is done if messages are piling up in the backlog. Droppable messages are expired to free the memory
# taken by expired messages. The interval should be between 0 and 1000, and in most installations the default value
# will be appropriate. A smaller value could potentially expire messages slightly sooner at the expense of more CPU
# time and queue contention while iterating the backlog of messages.
# An interval of 0 disables any wait time, which is the behavior of former Cassandra versions.
#
# otc_backlog_expiration_interval_ms: 200
