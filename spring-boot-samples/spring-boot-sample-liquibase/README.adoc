== Spring Boot Liquibase Sample

This sample demonstrates the liquibase auto-configuration support.

You can look at `http://localhost:8080/liquibase` to review the list of scripts.

This sample also enables the H2 console (at `http://localhost:8080/h2-console`)
so that you can review the state of the database (the default jdbc url is
`jdbc:h2:mem:testdb`).
