== Spring Boot - Samples - Web Services

This sample project demonstrates how to use http://projects.spring.io/spring-ws/[Spring Web Services]
with Spring Boot. It is an implementation of the
http://docs.spring.io/spring-ws/site/reference/html/tutorial.html#tutorial.implementing.endpoint[Holiday Request sample]
in the Spring Web Services reference guide.

The sample uses Maven. It can be built and run from the command line:

----
$ mvn spring-boot:run
----

http://localhost:8080/services/holidayService/holiday.wsdl will now display the generated WSDL.
