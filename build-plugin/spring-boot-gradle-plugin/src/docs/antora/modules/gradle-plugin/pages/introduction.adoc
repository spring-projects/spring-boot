The Spring Boot Gradle Plugin provides Spring Boot support in https://gradle.org[Gradle].
It allows you to package executable jar or war archives, run Spring Boot applications, and use the dependency management provided by `spring-boot-dependencies`.
Spring Boot's Gradle plugin requires Gradle 7.x (7.6.4 or later) or 8.x (8.4 or later) and can be used with Gradle's {url-gradle-docs}/configuration_cache.html[configuration cache].

In addition to this user guide, xref:api/java/index.html[API documentation] is also available.
