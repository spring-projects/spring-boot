SPRING BOOT CLI - INSTALLATION
==============================

Thank you for downloading the Spring Boot CLI tool. Please follow these instructions
in order to complete your installation.


Prerequisites
-------------
Spring Boot CLI requires Java JDK v1.6 or above in order to run. Groovy v2.1 is packaged
as part of this distribution, and therefore does not need to be installed (any existing
Groovy installation is ignored).

The CLI will use whatever JDK it finds on your path, to check that you have an appropriate
version you should run:

	java -version

Alternatively, you can set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to point an suitable JDK.


Environment Variables
---------------------
No specific environment variables are required to run the CLI, however, you may want to
set SPRING_HOME to point to a specific installation.  You should also add SPRING_HOME/bin
to your PATH environment variable.


Checking Your Installation
--------------------------
To test if you have successfully install the CLI you can run the following command:

	spring --version
